<h4>1</h4>
<p><sup>1</sup> Paul, summoned by the will <i>and</i> purpose of God to be an apostle (special messenger) of Christ Jesus, and our brother Sosthenes,
<p><sup>2</sup> To the church (assembly) of God which is in Corinth, to those consecrated <i>and</i> purified <i>and</i> made holy in Christ Jesus, <font color='#7a8080'>[who are]</font> selected <i>and</i> called to be saints (God's people), together with all those who in any place call upon <i>and</i> give honor to the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, both their Lord and ours:

<p><sup>3</sup> Grace (favor and spiritual blessing) be to you and <font color='#7a8080'>[heart]</font> peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.

<p><sup>4</sup> I thank my God at all times for you because of the grace (the favor and spiritual blessing) of God which was bestowed on you in Christ Jesus,

<p><sup>5</sup> <font color='#7a8080'>[So]</font> that in Him in every respect you were enriched, in full power <i>and</i> readiness of speech <font color='#7a8080'>[to speak of your faith]</font> and complete knowledge <i>and</i> illumination <font color='#7a8080'>[to give you full insight into its meaning]</font>.

<p><sup>6</sup> In this way <font color='#7a8080'>[our]</font> witnessing concerning Christ (the Messiah) was so confirmed <i>and</i> established <i>and</i> made sure in you

<p><sup>7</sup> That you are not <font color='#7a8080'>[consciously]</font> falling behind <i>or</i> lacking in any special spiritual endowment <i>or</i> Christian grace <font color='#7a8080'>[the reception of which is due to the power of divine grace operating in your souls by the Holy Spirit]</font>, while you wait <i>and</i> watch <font color='#7a8080'>[constantly living in hope]</font> for the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ <i>and</i> <font color='#7a8080'>[His]</font> being made visible to all.

<p><sup>8</sup> And He will establish you to the end <font color='#7a8080'>[keep you steadfast, give you strength, and guarantee your vindication; He will be your warrant against all accusation or indictment so that you will be]</font> guiltless <i>and</i> irreproachable in the day of our Lord Jesus Christ (the Messiah).

<p><sup>9</sup> God is faithful (reliable, trustworthy, and therefore ever true to His promise, and He can be depended on); by Him you were called into companionship <i>and</i> participation with His Son, Jesus Christ our Lord.

<p><sup>10</sup> But I urge <i>and</i> entreat you, brethren, by the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, that all of you be in perfect harmony <i>and</i> full agreement in what you say, and that there be no dissensions <i>or</i> factions <i>or</i> divisions among you, but that you be perfectly united in your common understanding and in your opinions <i>and</i> judgments.

<p><sup>11</sup> For it has been made clear to me, my brethren, by those of Chloe's household, that there are contentions <i>and</i> wrangling <i>and</i> factions among you.

<p><sup>12</sup> What I mean is this, that each one of you <font color='#7a8080'>[either]</font> says, I belong to Paul, or I belong to Apollos, or I belong to Cephas (Peter), or I belong to Christ.

<p><sup>13</sup> Is Christ (the Messiah) divided into parts? Was Paul crucified on behalf of you? Or were you baptized into the name of Paul?

<p><sup>14</sup> I thank God that I did not baptize any of you except Crispus and Gaius,

<p><sup>15</sup> Lest anyone should say that I baptized in my own name.

<p><sup>16</sup> <font color='#7a8080'>[Yes]</font> I did baptize the household of Stephanas also. More than these, I do not remember that I baptized anyone.

<p><sup>17</sup> For Christ (the Messiah) sent me out not to baptize but <font color='#7a8080'>[to evangelize by]</font> preaching the glad tidings (the Gospel), and that not with verbal eloquence, lest the cross of Christ should be deprived of force <i>and</i> emptied of its power <i>and</i> rendered vain (fruitless, void of value, and of no effect).

<p><sup>18</sup> For the story <i>and</i> message of the cross is sheer absurdity <i>and</i> folly to those who are perishing <i>and</i> on their way to perdition, but to us who are being saved it is the <font color='#7a8080'>[manifestation of]</font> the power of God.

<p><sup>19</sup> For it is written, I will baffle <i>and</i> render useless <i>and</i> destroy the learning of the learned <i>and</i> the philosophy of the philosophers and the cleverness of the clever <i>and</i> the discernment of the discerning; I will frustrate <i>and</i> nullify <font color='#7a8080'>[them]</font> <i>and</i> bring <font color='#7a8080'>[them]</font> to nothing.

<p><sup>20</sup> Where is the wise man (the philosopher)? Where is the scribe (the scholar)? Where is the investigator (the logician, the debater) of this present time <i>and</i> age? Has not God shown up the nonsense <i>and</i> the folly of this world's wisdom?

<p><sup>21</sup> For when the world with all its earthly wisdom failed to perceive <i>and</i> recognize <i>and</i> know God by means of its own philosophy, God in His wisdom was pleased through the foolishness of preaching <font color='#7a8080'>[salvation, procured by Christ and to be had through Him]</font>, to save those who believed (who clung to and trusted in and relied on Him).

<p><sup>22</sup> For while Jews <font color='#7a8080'>[demandingly]</font> ask for signs <i>and</i> miracles and Greeks pursue philosophy <i>and</i> wisdom,

<p><sup>23</sup> We preach Christ (the Messiah) crucified, <font color='#7a8080'>[preaching which]</font> to the Jews is a scandal <i>and</i> an offensive stumbling block <font color='#7a8080'>[that springs a snare or trap]</font>, and to the Gentiles it is absurd <i>and</i> utterly unphilosophical nonsense.

<p><sup>24</sup> But to those who are called, whether Jew or Greek (Gentile), Christ <font color='#7a8080'>[is]</font> the Power of God and the Wisdom of God.

<p><sup>25</sup> <font color='#7a8080'>[This is]</font> because the foolish thing <font color='#7a8080'>[that has its source in]</font> God is wiser than men, and the weak thing <font color='#7a8080'>[that springs]</font> from God is stronger than men.

<p><sup>26</sup> For <font color='#7a8080'>[simply]</font> consider your own call, brethren; not many <font color='#7a8080'>[of you were considered to be]</font> wise according to human estimates <i>and</i> standards, not many influential <i>and</i> powerful, not many of high <i>and</i> noble birth.

<p><sup>27</sup> <font color='#7a8080'>[No]</font> for God selected (deliberately chose) what in the world is foolish to put the wise to shame, and what the world calls weak to put the strong to shame.

<p><sup>28</sup> And God also selected (deliberately chose) what in the world is lowborn <i>and</i> insignificant and branded <i>and</i> treated with contempt, even the things that are nothing, that He might depose <i>and</i> bring to nothing the things that are,

<p><sup>29</sup> So that no mortal man should <font color='#7a8080'>[have pretense for glorying and]</font> boast in the presence of God.

<p><sup>30</sup> But it is from Him that you have your life in Christ Jesus, Whom God made our Wisdom from God, <font color='#7a8080'>[revealed to us a knowledge of the divine plan of salvation previously hidden, manifesting itself as]</font> our Righteousness <font color='#7a8080'>[thus making us upright and putting us in right standing with God]</font>, and our Consecration <font color='#7a8080'>[making us pure and holy]</font>, and our Redemption <font color='#7a8080'>[providing our ransom from eternal penalty for sin]</font>.

<p><sup>31</sup> So then, as it is written, Let him who boasts <i>and</i> proudly rejoices <i>and</i> glories, boast <i>and</i> proudly rejoice <i>and</i> glory in the Lord.

<h4>2</h4>
<p><sup>1</sup> As for myself, brethren, when I came to you, I did not come proclaiming to you the testimony <i>and</i> evidence <i>or</i> <i>mystery and secret</i> of God <font color='#7a8080'>[concerning what He has done through Christ for the salvation of men]</font> in lofty words of eloquence or human philosophy <i>and</i> wisdom;

<p><sup>2</sup> For I resolved to know nothing (to be acquainted with nothing, to make a display of the knowledge of nothing, and to be conscious of nothing) among you except Jesus Christ (the Messiah) and Him crucified.

<p><sup>3</sup> And I was in (passed into a state of) weakness and fear (dread) and great trembling <font color='#7a8080'>[after I had come]</font> among you.

<p><sup>4</sup> And my language and my message were not set forth in persuasive (enticing and plausible) words of wisdom, but they were in demonstration of the <font color='#7a8080'>[Holy]</font> Spirit and power <font color='#7a8080'>[a proof by the Spirit and power of God, operating on me and stirring in the minds of my hearers the most holy emotions and thus persuading them]</font>,

<p><sup>5</sup> So that your faith might not rest in the wisdom of men (human philosophy), but in the power of God.

<p><sup>6</sup> Yet when we are among the full-grown (spiritually mature Christians who are ripe in understanding), we do impart a <font color='#7a8080'>[higher]</font> wisdom (the knowledge of the divine plan previously hidden); but it is indeed not a wisdom of this present age <i>or</i> of this world nor of the leaders <i>and</i> rulers of this age, who are being brought to nothing <i>and</i> are doomed to pass away.

<p><sup>7</sup> But rather what we are setting forth is a wisdom of God once hidden <font color='#7a8080'>[from the human understanding]</font> and now revealed to us by God—<font color='#7a8080'>[that wisdom]</font> which God devised <i>and</i> decreed before the ages for our glorification <font color='#7a8080'>[to lift us into the glory of His presence]</font>.

<p><sup>8</sup> None of the rulers of this age <i>or</i> world perceived <i>and</i> recognized <i>and</i> understood this, for if they had, they would never have crucified the Lord of glory.

<p><sup>9</sup> But, on the contrary, as the Scripture says, What eye has not seen and ear has not heard and has not entered into the heart of man, <font color='#7a8080'>[all that]</font> God has prepared (made and keeps ready) for those who love Him <font color='#7a8080'>[who hold Him in affectionate reverence, promptly obeying Him and gratefully recognizing the benefits He has bestowed]</font>.

<p><sup>10</sup> Yet to us God has unveiled <i>and</i> revealed them by <i>and</i> through His Spirit, for the <font color='#7a8080'>[Holy]</font> Spirit searches diligently, exploring <i>and</i> examining everything, even sounding the profound and bottomless things of God <font color='#7a8080'>[the divine counsels and things hidden and beyond man's scrutiny]</font>.

<p><sup>11</sup> For what person perceives (knows and understands) what passes through a man's thoughts except the man's own spirit within him? Just so no one discerns (comes to know and comprehend) the thoughts of God except the Spirit of God.

<p><sup>12</sup> Now we have not received the spirit <font color='#7a8080'>[that belongs to]</font> the world, but the <font color='#7a8080'>[Holy]</font> Spirit Who is from God, <font color='#7a8080'>[given to us]</font> that we might realize <i>and</i> comprehend <i>and</i> appreciate the gifts <font color='#7a8080'>[of divine favor and blessing so freely and lavishly]</font> bestowed on us by God.

<p><sup>13</sup> And we are setting these truths forth in words not taught by human wisdom but taught by the <font color='#7a8080'>[Holy]</font> Spirit, combining <i>and</i> interpreting spiritual truths with spiritual language <font color='#7a8080'>[to those who possess the Holy Spirit]</font>.

<p><sup>14</sup> But the natural, nonspiritual man does not accept <i>or</i> welcome <i>or</i> admit into his heart the gifts <i>and</i> teachings <i>and</i> revelations of the Spirit of God, for they are folly (meaningless nonsense) to him; and he is incapable of knowing them <font color='#7a8080'>[of progressively recognizing, understanding, and becoming better acquainted with them]</font> because they are spiritually discerned <i>and</i> estimated <i>and</i> appreciated.

<p><sup>15</sup> But the spiritual man tries all things <font color='#7a8080'>[he examines, investigates, inquires into, questions, and discerns all things]</font>, yet is himself to be put on trial and judged by no one <font color='#7a8080'>[he can read the meaning of everything, but no one can properly discern <i>or</i> appraise <i>or</i> get an insight into him]</font>.

<p><sup>16</sup> For who has known <i>or</i> understood the mind (the counsels and purposes) of the Lord so as to guide <i>and</i> instruct Him <i>and</i> give Him knowledge? But we have the mind of Christ (the Messiah) <i>and</i> do hold the thoughts (feelings and purposes) of His heart.

<h4>3</h4>
<p><sup>1</sup> However, brethren, I could not talk to you as to spiritual <font color='#7a8080'>[men]</font>, but as to nonspiritual <font color='#7a8080'>[men of the flesh, in whom the carnal nature predominates]</font>, as to mere infants <font color='#7a8080'>[in the new life]</font> in Christ <font color='#7a8080'>[unable to talk yet!]</font>

<p><sup>2</sup> I fed you with milk, not solid food, for you were not yet strong enough <font color='#7a8080'>[to be ready for it]</font>; but even yet you are not strong enough <font color='#7a8080'>[to be ready for it]</font>,

<p><sup>3</sup> For you are still <font color='#7a8080'>[unspiritual, having the nature]</font> of the flesh <font color='#7a8080'>[under the control of ordinary impulses]</font>. For as long as <font color='#7a8080'>[there are]</font> envying and jealousy <i>and</i> wrangling and factions among you, are you not unspiritual <i>and</i> of the flesh, behaving yourselves after a human standard <i>and</i> like mere (unchanged) men?

<p><sup>4</sup> For when one says, I belong to Paul, and another, I belong to Apollos, are you not <font color='#7a8080'>[proving yourselves]</font> ordinary (unchanged) men?

<p><sup>5</sup> What then is Apollos? What is Paul? Ministering servants <font color='#7a8080'>[not heads of parties]</font> through whom you believed, even as the Lord appointed to each his task:

<p><sup>6</sup> I planted, Apollos watered, but God <font color='#7a8080'>[all the while]</font> was making it grow <i>and</i> <font color='#7a8080'>[He]</font> gave the increase.

<p><sup>7</sup> So neither he who plants is anything nor he who waters, but <font color='#7a8080'>[only]</font> God Who makes it grow <i>and</i> become greater.

<p><sup>8</sup> He who plants and he who waters are equal (one in aim, of the same importance and esteem), yet each shall receive his own reward (wages), according to his own labor.

<p><sup>9</sup> For we are fellow workmen (joint promoters, laborers together) with <i>and</i> for God; <i>you</i> are God's garden <i>and</i> vineyard <i>and</i> field under cultivation, <font color='#7a8080'>[you are]</font> God's building.

<p><sup>10</sup> According to the grace (the special endowment for my task) of God bestowed on me, like a skillful architect <i>and</i> master builder I laid <font color='#7a8080'>[the]</font> foundation, and now another <font color='#7a8080'>[man]</font> is building upon it. But let each <font color='#7a8080'>[man]</font> be careful how he builds upon it,

<p><sup>11</sup> For no other foundation can anyone lay than that which is <font color='#7a8080'>[already]</font> laid, which is Jesus Christ (the Messiah, the Anointed One).

<p><sup>12</sup> But if anyone builds upon the Foundation, whether it be with gold, silver, precious stones, wood, hay, straw,

<p><sup>13</sup> The work of each <font color='#7a8080'>[one]</font> will become <font color='#7a8080'>[plainly, openly]</font> known (shown for what it is); for the day <font color='#7a8080'>[of Christ]</font> will disclose <i>and</i> declare it, because it will be revealed with fire, and the fire will test <i>and</i> critically appraise the character <i>and</i> worth of the work each person has done.

<p><sup>14</sup> If the work which any person has built on this Foundation <font color='#7a8080'>[any product of his efforts whatever]</font> survives <font color='#7a8080'>[this test]</font>, he will get his reward.

<p><sup>15</sup> But if any person's work is burned up <font color='#7a8080'>[under the test]</font>, he will suffer the loss <font color='#7a8080'>[of it all, losing his reward]</font>, though he himself will be saved, but only as <font color='#7a8080'>[one who has passed]</font> through fire.

<p><sup>16</sup> Do you not discern <i>and</i> understand that you <font color='#7a8080'>[the whole church at Corinth]</font> are God's temple (His sanctuary), and that God's Spirit has His permanent dwelling in you <font color='#7a8080'>[to be at home in you, collectively as a church and also individually]</font>?

<p><sup>17</sup> If anyone does hurt to God's temple <i>or</i> corrupts it <font color='#7a8080'>[with false doctrines]</font> <i>or</i> destroys it, God will do hurt to him <i>and</i> bring him to the corruption of death <i>and</i> destroy him. For the temple of God is holy (sacred to Him) and that <font color='#7a8080'>[temple]</font> you <font color='#7a8080'>[the believing church and its individual believers]</font> are.

<p><sup>18</sup> Let no person deceive himself. If anyone among you supposes that he is wise in this age, let him become a fool <font color='#7a8080'>[let him discard his worldly discernment and recognize himself as dull, stupid, and foolish, without true learning and scholarship]</font>, that he may become <font color='#7a8080'>[really]</font> wise.

<p><sup>19</sup> For this world's wisdom is foolishness (absurdity and stupidity) with God, for it is written, He lays hold of the wise in their <font color='#7a8080'>[own]</font> craftiness;

<p><sup>20</sup> And again, The Lord knows the thoughts <i>and</i> reasonings of the <font color='#7a8080'>[humanly]</font> wise <i>and</i> recognizes how futile they are.

<p><sup>21</sup> So let no one exult proudly concerning men <font color='#7a8080'>[boasting of having this or that man as a leader]</font>, for all things are yours,

<p><sup>22</sup> Whether Paul or Apollos or Cephas (Peter), or the universe or life or death, or the immediate <i>and</i> threatening present or the <font color='#7a8080'>[subsequent and uncertain]</font> future—all are yours,

<p><sup>23</sup> And you are Christ's, and Christ is God's.

<h4>4</h4>
<p><sup>1</sup> So then, let us <font color='#7a8080'>[apostles]</font> be looked upon as ministering servants of Christ and stewards (trustees) of the mysteries (the secret purposes) of God.

<p><sup>2</sup> Moreover, it is <font color='#7a8080'>[essentially]</font> required of stewards that a man should be found faithful <font color='#7a8080'>[proving himself worthy of trust]</font>.

<p><sup>3</sup> But <font color='#7a8080'>[as for me personally]</font> it matters very little to me that I should be put on trial by you <font color='#7a8080'>[on this point]</font>, <i>and</i> that you or any other human tribunal should investigate <i>and</i> question <i>and</i> cross-question me. I do not even put myself on trial <i>and</i> judge myself.

<p><sup>4</sup> I am not conscious of anything against myself, <i>and</i> I feel blameless; but I am not vindicated <i>and</i> acquitted before God on that account. It is the Lord <font color='#7a8080'>[Himself]</font> Who examines <i>and</i> judges me.

<p><sup>5</sup> So do not make any hasty <i>or</i> premature judgments before the time when the Lord comes <font color='#7a8080'>[again]</font>, for He will both bring to light the secret things that are <font color='#7a8080'>[now hidden]</font> in darkness and disclose <i>and</i> expose the <font color='#7a8080'>[secret]</font> aims (motives and purposes) of hearts. Then every man will receive his <font color='#7a8080'>[due]</font> commendation from God.

<p><sup>6</sup> Now I have applied all this <font color='#7a8080'>[about parties and factions]</font> to myself and Apollos for your sakes, brethren, so that from what I have said of us <font color='#7a8080'>[as illustrations]</font>, you may learn <font color='#7a8080'>[to think of men in accordance with Scripture and]</font> not to go beyond that which is written, that none of you may be puffed up <i>and</i> inflated with pride <i>and</i> boast in favor of one <font color='#7a8080'>[minister and teacher]</font> against another.

<p><sup>7</sup> For who separates you from the others <font color='#7a8080'>[as a faction leader]</font>? <font color='#7a8080'>[Who makes you superior and sets you apart from another, giving you the preeminence?]</font> What have you that was not given to you? If then you received it <font color='#7a8080'>[from someone]</font>, why do you boast as if you had not received <font color='#7a8080'>[but had gained it by your own efforts]</font>?

<p><sup>8</sup> <font color='#7a8080'>[You behave as if]</font> you are already filled <i>and</i> think you have enough <font color='#7a8080'>[you are full and content, feeling no need of anything more]</font>! Already you have become rich <font color='#7a8080'>[in spiritual gifts and graces]</font>! <font color='#7a8080'>[Without any counsel or instruction from us, in your conceit]</font>, you have ascended your thrones <i>and</i> come into your kingdom without including us! And would that it were true <i>and</i> that you did reign, so that we might be sharing the kingdom with you!

<p><sup>9</sup> For it seems to me that God has made an exhibit of us apostles, exposing us to view last <font color='#7a8080'>[of all, like men in a triumphal procession who are]</font> sentenced to death <font color='#7a8080'>[and displayed at the end of the line]</font>. For we have become a spectacle to the world <font color='#7a8080'>[a show in the world's amphitheater]</font> with both men and angels <font color='#7a8080'>[as spectators]</font>.

<p><sup>10</sup> We are <font color='#7a8080'>[looked upon as]</font> fools on account of Christ <i>and</i> for His sake, but you are <font color='#7a8080'>[supposedly]</font> so amazingly wise <i>and</i> prudent in Christ! We are weak, but you are <font color='#7a8080'>[so very]</font> strong! You are highly esteemed, but we are in disrepute <i>and</i> contempt!

<p><sup>11</sup> To this hour we have gone both hungry and thirsty; we <font color='#7a8080'>[habitually]</font> wear but one undergarment <font color='#7a8080'>[and shiver in the cold]</font>; we are roughly knocked about and wander around homeless.

<p><sup>12</sup> And we still toil unto weariness <font color='#7a8080'>[for our living]</font>, working hard with our own hands. When men revile us <font color='#7a8080'>[wound us with an accursed sting]</font>, we bless them. When we are persecuted, we take it patiently <i>and</i> endure it.

<p><sup>13</sup> When we are slandered <i>and</i> defamed, we <font color='#7a8080'>[try to]</font> answer softly <i>and</i> bring comfort. We have been made and are now the rubbish <i>and</i> filth of the world <font color='#7a8080'>[the offscouring of all things, the scum of the earth]</font>.

<p><sup>14</sup> I do not write this to shame you, but to warn <i>and</i> counsel you as my beloved children.

<p><sup>15</sup> After all, though you should have ten thousand teachers (guides to direct you) in Christ, yet you do not have many fathers. For I became your father in Christ Jesus through the glad tidings (the Gospel).

<p><sup>16</sup> So I urge <i>and</i> implore you, be imitators of me.

<p><sup>17</sup> For this very cause I sent to you Timothy, who is my beloved and trustworthy child in the Lord, who will recall to your minds my methods of proceeding <i>and</i> course of conduct <i>and</i> way of life in Christ, such as I teach everywhere in each of the churches.

<p><sup>18</sup> Some of you have become conceited <i>and</i> arrogant <i>and</i> pretentious, counting on my not coming to you.

<p><sup>19</sup> But I will come to you <font color='#7a8080'>[and]</font> shortly, if the Lord is willing, and then I will perceive <i>and</i> understand not what the talk of these puffed up <i>and</i> arrogant spirits amount to, but their force (the moral power and excellence of soul they really possess).

<p><sup>20</sup> For the kingdom of God consists of <i>and</i> is based on not talk but power (moral power and excellence of soul).

<p><sup>21</sup> Now which do you prefer? Shall I come to you with a rod of correction, or with love and in a spirit of gentleness?

<h4>5</h4>
<p><sup>1</sup> It is actually reported that there is sexual immorality among you, impurity of a sort that is condemned <i>and</i> does not occur even among the heathen; for a man has <font color='#7a8080'>[his own]</font> father's wife.

<p><sup>2</sup> And you are proud <i>and</i> arrogant! And you ought rather to mourn (bow in sorrow and in shame) until the person who has done this <font color='#7a8080'>[shameful]</font> thing is removed from your fellowship <i>and</i> your midst!

<p><sup>3</sup> As for my attitude, though I am absent <font color='#7a8080'>[from you]</font> in body, I am present in spirit, and I have already decided <i>and</i> passed judgment, as if actually present,

<p><sup>4</sup> In the name of the Lord Jesus <i>Christ</i>, on the man who has committed such a deed. When you and my own spirit are met together with the power of our Lord Jesus,

<p><sup>5</sup> You are to deliver this man over to Satan for physical discipline <font color='#7a8080'>[to destroy carnal lusts which prompted him to incest]</font>, that <font color='#7a8080'>[his]</font> spirit may <font color='#7a8080'>[yet]</font> be saved in the day of the Lord Jesus.

<p><sup>6</sup> <font color='#7a8080'>[About the condition of your church]</font> your boasting is not good <font color='#7a8080'>[indeed, it is most unseemly and entirely out of place]</font>. Do you not know that <font color='#7a8080'>[just]</font> a little leaven will ferment the whole lump <font color='#7a8080'>[of dough]</font>?

<p><sup>7</sup> Purge (clean out) the old leaven that you may be fresh (new) dough, still uncontaminated <font color='#7a8080'>[as you are]</font>, for Christ, our Passover <font color='#7a8080'>[Lamb]</font>, has been sacrificed.

<p><sup>8</sup> Therefore, let us keep the feast, not with old leaven, nor with leaven of vice <i>and</i> malice and wickedness, but with the unleavened <font color='#7a8080'>[bread]</font> of purity (nobility, honor) <i>and</i> sincerity and <font color='#7a8080'>[unadulterated]</font> truth.

<p><sup>9</sup> I wrote you in my <font color='#7a8080'>[previous]</font> letter not to associate <font color='#7a8080'>[closely and habitually]</font> with unchaste (impure) people—

<p><sup>10</sup> Not <font color='#7a8080'>[meaning of course that you must]</font> altogether shun the immoral people of this world, or the greedy graspers and cheats <i>and</i> thieves or idolaters, since otherwise you would need to get out of the world <i>and</i> human society altogether!

<p><sup>11</sup> But now I write to you not to associate with anyone who bears the name of <font color='#7a8080'>[Christian]</font> brother if he is known to be guilty of immorality or greed, or is an idolater <font color='#7a8080'>[whose soul is devoted to any object that usurps the place of God]</font>, or is a person with a foul tongue <font color='#7a8080'>[railing, abusing, reviling, slandering]</font>, or is a drunkard or a swindler <i>or</i> a robber. <font color='#7a8080'>[No]</font> you must not so much as eat with such a person.

<p><sup>12</sup> What <font color='#7a8080'>[business]</font> of mine is it <i>and</i> what right have I to judge outsiders? Is it not those inside <font color='#7a8080'>[the church]</font> upon whom you are to pass disciplinary judgment <font color='#7a8080'>[passing censuring sentence on them as the facts require]</font>?

<p><sup>13</sup> God alone sits in judgment on those who are outside. Drive out that wicked one from among you <font color='#7a8080'>[expel him from your church]</font>.

<p><sup>1</sup> Does any of you dare, when he has a matter of complaint against another <font color='#7a8080'>[brother]</font>, to go to law before unrighteous men <font color='#7a8080'>[men neither upright nor right with God, laying it before them]</font> instead of before the saints (the people of God)?

<p><sup>2</sup> Do you not know that the saints (the believers) will <font color='#7a8080'>[one day]</font> judge <i>and</i> govern the world? And if the world <font color='#7a8080'>[itself]</font> is to be judged <i>and</i> ruled by you, are you unworthy <i>and</i> incompetent to try <font color='#7a8080'>[such petty matters]</font> of the smallest courts of justice?

<p><sup>3</sup> Do you not know also that we <font color='#7a8080'>[Christians]</font> are to judge the <font color='#7a8080'>[very]</font> angels <i>and</i> pronounce opinion between right and wrong <font color='#7a8080'>[for them]</font>? How much more then <font color='#7a8080'>[as to]</font> matters pertaining to this world <i>and</i> of this life only!

<p><sup>4</sup> If then you do have such cases of everyday life to decide, why do you appoint <font color='#7a8080'>[as judges to lay them before]</font> those who <font color='#7a8080'>[from the standpoint]</font> of the church count for least <i>and</i> are without standing?

<p><sup>5</sup> I say this to move you to shame. Can it be that there really is not one man among you who <font color='#7a8080'>[in action is governed by piety and integrity and]</font> is wise <i>and</i> competent enough to decide <font color='#7a8080'>[the private grievances, disputes, and quarrels]</font> between members of the brotherhood,

<p><sup>6</sup> But brother goes to law against brother, and that before <font color='#7a8080'>[Gentile judges who are]</font> unbelievers <font color='#7a8080'>[without faith or trust in the Gospel of Christ]</font>?

<p><sup>7</sup> Why, the very fact of your having lawsuits with one another at all is a defect (a defeat, an evidence of positive moral loss for you). Why not rather let yourselves suffer wrong <i>and</i> be deprived of what is your due? Why not rather be cheated (defrauded and robbed)?

<p><sup>8</sup> But <font color='#7a8080'>[instead it is you]</font> yourselves who wrong and defraud, and that even your own brethren <font color='#7a8080'>[by so treating them]</font>!

<p><sup>9</sup> Do you not know that the unrighteous <i>and</i> the wrongdoers will not inherit <i>or</i> have any share in the kingdom of God? Do not be deceived (misled): neither the impure <i>and</i> immoral, nor idolaters, nor adulterers, nor those who participate in homosexuality,

<p><sup>10</sup> Nor cheats (swindlers and thieves), nor greedy graspers, nor drunkards, nor foulmouthed revilers <i>and</i> slanderers, nor extortioners <i>and</i> robbers will inherit <i>or</i> have any share in the kingdom of God.

<p><sup>11</sup> And such some of you were <font color='#7a8080'>[once]</font>. But you were washed clean (purified by a complete atonement for sin and made free from the guilt of sin), and you were consecrated (set apart, hallowed), and you were justified <font color='#7a8080'>[pronounced righteous, by trusting]</font> in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ and in the <font color='#7a8080'>[Holy]</font> Spirit of our God.

<p><sup>12</sup> Everything is permissible (allowable and lawful) for me; but not all things are helpful (good for me to do, expedient and profitable when considered with other things). Everything is lawful for me, but I will not become the slave of anything <i>or</i> be brought under its power.

<p><sup>13</sup> Food <font color='#7a8080'>[is intended]</font> for the stomach and the stomach for food, but God will finally end <font color='#7a8080'>[the functions of]</font> both <i>and</i> bring them to nothing. The body is not intended for sexual immorality, but <font color='#7a8080'>[is intended]</font> for the Lord, and the Lord <font color='#7a8080'>[is intended]</font> for the body <font color='#7a8080'>[to save, sanctify, and raise it again]</font>.

<p><sup>14</sup> And God both raised the Lord to life and will also raise us up by His power.

<p><sup>15</sup> Do you not see <i>and</i> know that your bodies are members (bodily parts) of Christ (the Messiah)? Am I therefore to take the parts of Christ and make <font color='#7a8080'>[them]</font> parts of a prostitute? Never! Never!

<p><sup>16</sup> Or do you not know <i>and</i> realize that when a man joins himself to a prostitute, he becomes one body with her? The two, it is written, shall become one flesh.

<p><sup>17</sup> But the person who is united to the Lord becomes one spirit with Him.

<p><sup>18</sup> Shun immorality <i>and</i> all sexual looseness <font color='#7a8080'>[flee from impurity in thought, word, or deed]</font>. Any other sin which a man commits is one outside the body, but he who commits sexual immorality sins against his own body.

<p><sup>19</sup> Do you not know that your body is the temple (the very sanctuary) of the Holy Spirit Who lives within you, Whom you have received <font color='#7a8080'>[as a Gift]</font> from God? You are not your own,

<p><sup>20</sup> You were bought with a price <font color='#7a8080'>[purchased with a preciousness and paid for, made His own]</font>. So then, honor God <i>and</i> bring glory to Him in your body.

<h4>7</h4>
<p><sup>1</sup> Now as to the matters of which you wrote me. It is well <font color='#7a8080'>[and by that I mean advantageous, expedient, profitable, and wholesome]</font> for a man not to touch a woman <font color='#7a8080'>[to cohabit with her]</font> <i>but</i> to remain unmarried.

<p><sup>2</sup> But because of the temptation to impurity <i>and</i> to avoid immorality, let each <font color='#7a8080'>[man]</font> have his own wife and let each <font color='#7a8080'>[woman]</font> have her own husband.

<p><sup>3</sup> The husband should give to his wife her conjugal rights (goodwill, kindness, and what is due her as his wife), and likewise the wife to her husband.

<p><sup>4</sup> For the wife does not have <font color='#7a8080'>[exclusive]</font> authority <i>and</i> control over her own body, but the husband <font color='#7a8080'>[has his rights]</font>; likewise also the husband does not have <font color='#7a8080'>[exclusive]</font> authority <i>and</i> control over his body, but the wife <font color='#7a8080'>[has her rights]</font>.

<p><sup>5</sup> Do not refuse <i>and</i> deprive <i>and</i> defraud each other <font color='#7a8080'>[of your due marital rights]</font>, except perhaps by mutual consent for a time, so that you may devote yourselves unhindered to prayer. But afterwards resume marital relations, lest Satan tempt you <font color='#7a8080'>[to sin]</font> through your lack of restraint of sexual desire.

<p><sup>6</sup> But I am saying this more as a matter of permission <i>and</i> concession, not as a command <i>or</i> regulation.

<p><sup>7</sup> I wish that all men were like I myself am <font color='#7a8080'>[in this matter of self-control]</font>. But each has his own special gift from God, one of this kind and one of another.

<p><sup>8</sup> But to the unmarried people and to the widows, I declare that it is well (good, advantageous, expedient, and wholesome) for them to remain <font color='#7a8080'>[single]</font> even as I do.

<p><sup>9</sup> But if they have not self-control (restraint of their passions), they should marry. For it is better to marry than to be aflame <font color='#7a8080'>[with passion and tortured continually with ungratified desire]</font>.

<p><sup>10</sup> But to the married people I give charge—not I but the Lord—that the wife is not to separate from her husband.

<p><sup>11</sup> But if she does <font color='#7a8080'>[separate from and divorce him]</font>, let her remain single or else be reconciled to her husband. And <font color='#7a8080'>[I charge]</font> the husband <font color='#7a8080'>[also]</font> that he should not put away <i>or</i> divorce his wife.

<p><sup>12</sup> To the rest I declare—I, not the Lord <font color='#7a8080'>[for Jesus did not discuss this]</font>—that if any brother has a wife who does not believe <font color='#7a8080'>[in Christ]</font> and she consents to live with him, he should not leave <i>or</i> divorce her.

<p><sup>13</sup> And if any woman has an unbelieving husband and he consents to live with her, she should not leave <i>or</i> divorce him.

<p><sup>14</sup> For the unbelieving husband is set apart (separated, withdrawn from heathen contamination, and affiliated with the Christian people) by union with his consecrated (set-apart) wife, and the unbelieving wife is set apart <i>and</i> separated through union with her consecrated husband. Otherwise your children would be unclean (unblessed heathen, outside the Christian covenant), but as it is they are prepared for God <font color='#7a8080'>[pure and clean]</font>.

<p><sup>15</sup> But if the unbelieving partner <font color='#7a8080'>[actually]</font> leaves, let him do so; in such <font color='#7a8080'>[cases the remaining]</font> brother or sister is not morally bound. But God has called us to peace.

<p><sup>16</sup> For, wife, how can you be sure of converting <i>and</i> saving your husband? Husband, how can you be sure of converting <i>and</i> saving your wife?

<p><sup>17</sup> Only, let each one <font color='#7a8080'>[seek to conduct himself and regulate his affairs so as to]</font> lead the life which the Lord has allotted <i>and</i> imparted to him and to which God has invited <i>and</i> summoned him. This is my order in all the churches.

<p><sup>18</sup> Was anyone at the time of his summons <font color='#7a8080'>[from God]</font> already circumcised? Let him not seek to remove the evidence of circumcision. Was anyone at the time <font color='#7a8080'>[God]</font> called him uncircumcised? Let him not be circumcised.

<p><sup>19</sup> For circumcision is nothing <i>and</i> counts for nothing, neither does uncircumcision, but <font color='#7a8080'>[what counts is]</font> keeping the commandments of God.

<p><sup>20</sup> Everyone should remain after God calls him in the station <i>or</i> condition of life in which the summons found him.

<p><sup>21</sup> Were you a slave when you were called? Do not let that trouble you. But if you are able to gain your freedom, avail yourself of the opportunity.

<p><sup>22</sup> For he who as a slave was summoned in <font color='#7a8080'>[to union with]</font> the Lord is a freedman of the Lord, just so he who was free when he was called is a bond servant of Christ (the Messiah).

<p><sup>23</sup> You were bought with a price <font color='#7a8080'>[purchased with a preciousness and paid for by Christ]</font>; then do not yield yourselves up to become <font color='#7a8080'>[in your own estimation]</font> slaves to men <font color='#7a8080'>[but consider yourselves slaves to Christ]</font>.

<p><sup>24</sup> So, brethren, in whatever station <i>or</i> state <i>or</i> condition of life each one was when he was called, there let him continue with <i>and</i> close to God.

<p><sup>25</sup> Now concerning the virgins (the marriageable maidens) I have no command of the Lord, but I give my opinion <i>and</i> advice as one who by the Lord's mercy is rendered trustworthy <i>and</i> faithful.

<p><sup>26</sup> I think then, because of the impending distress <font color='#7a8080'>[that is even now setting in]</font>, it is well (expedient, profitable, and wholesome) for a person to remain as he <i>or</i> she is.

<p><sup>27</sup> Are you bound to a wife? Do not seek to be free. Are you free from a wife? Do not seek a wife.

<p><sup>28</sup> But if you do marry, you do not sin <font color='#7a8080'>[in doing so]</font>, and if a virgin marries, she does not sin <font color='#7a8080'>[in doing so]</font>. Yet those who marry will have physical <i>and</i> earthly troubles, and I would like to spare you that.

<p><sup>29</sup> I mean, brethren, the appointed time has been winding down <i>and</i> it has grown very short. From now on, let even those who have wives be as if they had none,

<p><sup>30</sup> And those who weep <i>and</i> mourn as though they were not weeping <i>and</i> mourning, and those who rejoice as though they were not rejoicing, and those who buy as though they did not possess anything,

<p><sup>31</sup> And those who deal with this world <font color='#7a8080'>[overusing the enjoyments of this life]</font> as though they were not absorbed by it <i>and</i> as if they had no dealings with it. For the outward form of this world (the present world order) is passing away.

<p><sup>32</sup> My desire is to have you free from all anxiety <i>and</i> distressing care. The unmarried man is anxious about the things of the Lord—how he may please the Lord;

<p><sup>33</sup> But the married man is anxious about worldly matters—how he may please his wife—

<p><sup>34</sup> And he is drawn in diverging directions <font color='#7a8080'>[his interests are divided <i>and</i> he is distracted from his devotion to God]</font>. And the unmarried woman or girl is concerned <i>and</i> anxious about the matters of the Lord, how to be wholly separated <i>and</i> set apart in body and spirit; but the married woman has her cares <font color='#7a8080'>[centered]</font> in earthly affairs—how she may please her husband.

<p><sup>35</sup> Now I say this for your own welfare <i>and</i> profit, not to put <font color='#7a8080'>[a halter of]</font> restraint upon you, but to promote what is seemly <i>and</i> in good order and to secure your undistracted <i>and</i> undivided devotion to the Lord.

<p><sup>36</sup> But if any man thinks that he is not acting properly toward <i>and</i> in regard to his virgin <font color='#7a8080'>[that he is preparing disgrace for her or incurring reproach]</font>, in case she is passing the bloom of her youth and if there is need for it, let him do what to him seems right; he does not sin; let them marry.

<p><sup>37</sup> But whoever is firmly established in his heart <font color='#7a8080'>[strong in mind and purpose]</font>, not being forced by necessity but having control over his own will <i>and</i> desire, and has resolved this in his heart to keep his own virginity, he is doing well.

<p><sup>38</sup> So also then, he <font color='#7a8080'>[the father]</font> who gives his virgin (his daughter) in marriage does well, and he <font color='#7a8080'>[the father]</font> who does not give <font color='#7a8080'>[her]</font> in marriage does better.

<p><sup>39</sup> A wife is bound to her husband by law as long as he lives. If the husband dies, she is free to be married to whom she will, only <font color='#7a8080'>[provided that he too is]</font> in the Lord.

<p><sup>40</sup> But in my opinion <font color='#7a8080'>[a widow]</font> is happier (more blessed and to be envied) if she does not remarry. And also I think I have the Spirit of God.

<h4>8</h4>
<p><sup>1</sup> Now about food offered to idols: of course we know that all of us possess knowledge <font color='#7a8080'>[concerning these matters. Yet mere]</font> knowledge causes people to be puffed up (to bear themselves loftily and be proud), but love (affection and goodwill and benevolence) edifies <i>and</i> builds up <i>and</i> encourages one to grow <font color='#7a8080'>[to his full stature]</font>.

<p><sup>2</sup> If anyone imagines that he has come to know <i>and</i> understand much <font color='#7a8080'>[of divine things, without love]</font>, he does not yet perceive <i>and</i> recognize <i>and</i> understand as strongly <i>and</i> clearly, <i>nor</i> has he become as intimately acquainted with anything as he ought <i>or</i> as is necessary.

<p><sup>3</sup> But if one loves God truly <font color='#7a8080'>[with affectionate reverence, prompt obedience, and grateful recognition of His blessing]</font>, he is known by God <font color='#7a8080'>[recognized as worthy of His intimacy and love, and he is owned by Him]</font>.

<p><sup>4</sup> In this matter, then, of eating food offered to idols, we know that an idol is nothing (has no real existence) and that there is no God but one.

<p><sup>5</sup> For although there may be so-called gods, whether in heaven or on earth, as indeed there are many of them, both of gods and of lords <i>and</i> masters,

<p><sup>6</sup> Yet for us there is <font color='#7a8080'>[only]</font> one God, the Father, Who is the Source of all things and for Whom we <font color='#7a8080'>[have life]</font>, and one Lord, Jesus Christ, through <i>and</i> by Whom are all things and through <i>and</i> by Whom we <font color='#7a8080'>[ourselves exist]</font>.

<p><sup>7</sup> Nevertheless, not all <font color='#7a8080'>[believers]</font> possess this knowledge. But some, through being all their lives until now accustomed to <font color='#7a8080'>[thinking of]</font> idols <font color='#7a8080'>[as real and living]</font>, still consider the food <font color='#7a8080'>[offered to an idol]</font> as that sacrificed to an <font color='#7a8080'>[actual]</font> god; and their weak consciences become defiled <i>and</i> injured if they eat <font color='#7a8080'>[it]</font>.

<p><sup>8</sup> Now food <font color='#7a8080'>[itself]</font> will not cause our acceptance by God <i>nor</i> commend us to Him. Eating <font color='#7a8080'>[food offered to idols]</font> gives us no advantage; neither do we come short <i>or</i> become any worse if we do not eat <font color='#7a8080'>[it]</font>.

<p><sup>9</sup> Only be careful that this power of choice (this permission and liberty to do as you please) which is yours, does not <font color='#7a8080'>[somehow]</font> become a hindrance (cause of stumbling) to the weak <i>or</i> overscrupulous <font color='#7a8080'>[giving them an impulse to sin]</font>.

<p><sup>10</sup> For suppose someone sees you, a man having knowledge <font color='#7a8080'>[of God, with an intelligent view of this subject and]</font> reclining at table in an idol's temple, might he not be encouraged <i>and</i> emboldened <font color='#7a8080'>[to violate his own conscientious scruples]</font> if he is weak <i>and</i> uncertain, and eat what <font color='#7a8080'>[to him]</font> is for the purpose of idol worship?

<p><sup>11</sup> And so by your enlightenment (your knowledge of spiritual things), this weak man is ruined (is lost and perishes)—the brother for whom Christ (the Messiah) died!

<p><sup>12</sup> And when you sin against your brethren in this way, wounding <i>and</i> damaging their weak conscience, you sin against Christ.

<p><sup>13</sup> Therefore, if <font color='#7a8080'>[my eating a]</font> food is a cause of my brother's falling <i>or</i> of hindering <font color='#7a8080'>[his spiritual advancement]</font>, I will not eat <font color='#7a8080'>[such]</font> flesh forever, lest I cause my brother to be tripped up <i>and</i> fall <i>and</i> to be offended.

<h4>9</h4>
<p><sup>1</sup> Am I not an apostle (a special messenger)? Am I not free (unrestrained and exempt from any obligation)? Have I not seen Jesus our Lord? Are you <font color='#7a8080'>[yourselves]</font> not <font color='#7a8080'>[the product and proof of]</font> my workmanship in the Lord?

<p><sup>2</sup> Even if I am not considered an apostle (a special messenger) by others, at least I am one to you; for you are the seal (the certificate, the living evidence) of my apostleship in the Lord <font color='#7a8080'>[confirming and authenticating it]</font>.

<p><sup>3</sup> This is my <font color='#7a8080'>[real ground of]</font> defense (my vindication of myself) to those who would put me on trial <i>and</i> cross-examine me.

<p><sup>4</sup> Have we not the right to our food and drink <font color='#7a8080'>[at the expense of the churches]</font>?

<p><sup>5</sup> Have we not the right also to take along with us a Christian sister as wife, as do the other apostles and the Lord's brothers and Cephas (Peter)?

<p><sup>6</sup> Or is it only Barnabas and I who have no right to refrain from doing manual labor for a livelihood <font color='#7a8080'>[in order to go about the work of the ministry]</font>?

<p><sup>7</sup> <font color='#7a8080'>[Consider this:]</font> What soldier at any time serves at his own expense? Who plants a vineyard and does not eat any of the fruit of it? Who tends a flock and does not partake of the milk of the flock?

<p><sup>8</sup> Do I say this only on human authority <i>and</i> as a man reasons? Does not the Law endorse the same principle?

<p><sup>9</sup> For in the Law of Moses it is written, You shall not muzzle an ox when it is treading out the corn. Is it <font color='#7a8080'>[only]</font> for oxen that God cares?

<p><sup>10</sup> Or does He speak certainly <i>and</i> entirely for our sakes? <font color='#7a8080'>[Assuredly]</font> it is written for our sakes, because the plowman ought to plow in hope, and the thresher ought to thresh in expectation of partaking of the harvest.

<p><sup>11</sup> If we have sown <font color='#7a8080'>[the seed of]</font> spiritual good among you, <font color='#7a8080'>[is it too]</font> much if we reap from your material benefits?

<p><sup>12</sup> If others share in this rightful claim upon you, do not we <font color='#7a8080'>[have a still better and greater claim]</font>? However, we have never exercised this right, but we endure everything rather than put a hindrance in the way <font color='#7a8080'>[of the spread]</font> of the good news (the Gospel) of Christ.

<p><sup>13</sup> Do you not know that those men who are employed in the services of the temple get their food from the temple? And that those who tend the altar share with the altar <font color='#7a8080'>[in the offerings brought]</font>?

<p><sup>14</sup> <font color='#7a8080'>[On the same principle]</font> the Lord directed that those who publish the good news (the Gospel) should live (get their maintenance) by the Gospel.

<p><sup>15</sup> But I have not made use of any of these privileges, nor am I writing this <font color='#7a8080'>[to suggest]</font> that any such provision be made for me <font color='#7a8080'>[now]</font>. For it would be better for me to die than to have anyone make void <i>and</i> deprive me of my <font color='#7a8080'>[ground for]</font> glorifying <font color='#7a8080'>[in this matter]</font>.

<p><sup>16</sup> For if I <font color='#7a8080'>[merely]</font> preach the Gospel, that gives me no reason to boast, for I feel compelled of necessity to do it. Woe is me if I do not preach the glad tidings (the Gospel)!

<p><sup>17</sup> For if I do this work of my own free will, then I have my pay (my reward); but if it is not of my own will, but is done reluctantly <i>and</i> under compulsion, I am <font color='#7a8080'>[still]</font> entrusted with a <font color='#7a8080'>[sacred]</font> trusteeship <i>and</i> commission.

<p><sup>18</sup> What then is the <font color='#7a8080'>[actual]</font> reward that I get? Just this: that in my preaching the good news (the Gospel), I may offer it <font color='#7a8080'>[absolutely]</font> free of expense <font color='#7a8080'>[to anybody]</font>, not taking advantage of my rights <i>and</i> privileges <font color='#7a8080'>[as a preacher]</font> of the Gospel.

<p><sup>19</sup> For although I am free in every way from anyone's control, I have made myself a bond servant to everyone, so that I might gain the more <font color='#7a8080'>[for Christ]</font>.

<p><sup>20</sup> To the Jews I became as a Jew, that I might win Jews; to men under the Law, <font color='#7a8080'>[I became]</font> as one under the Law, though not myself being under the Law, that I might win those under the Law.

<p><sup>21</sup> To those without (outside) law I became as one without law, not that I am without the law of God <i>and</i> lawless toward Him, but that I am <font color='#7a8080'>[especially keeping]</font> within <i>and</i> committed to the law of Christ, that I might win those who are without law.

<p><sup>22</sup> To the weak (wanting in discernment) I have become weak (wanting in discernment) that I might win the weak <i>and</i> overscrupulous. I have <font color='#7a8080'>[in short]</font> become all things to all men, that I might by all means (at all costs and in any and every way) save some <font color='#7a8080'>[by winning them to faith in Jesus Christ]</font>.

<p><sup>23</sup> And I do this for the sake of the good news (the Gospel), in order that I may become a participator in it <i>and</i> share in its <font color='#7a8080'>[blessings along with you]</font>.

<p><sup>24</sup> Do you not know that in a race all the runners compete, but <font color='#7a8080'>[only]</font> one receives the prize? So run <font color='#7a8080'>[your race]</font> that you may lay hold <font color='#7a8080'>[of the prize]</font> <i>and</i> make it yours.

<p><sup>25</sup> Now every athlete who goes into training conducts himself temperately <i>and</i> restricts himself in all things. They do it to win a wreath that will soon wither, but we <font color='#7a8080'>[do it to receive a crown of eternal blessedness]</font> that cannot wither.

<p><sup>26</sup> Therefore I do not run uncertainly (without definite aim). I do not box like one beating the air <i>and</i> striking without an adversary.

<p><sup>27</sup> But <font color='#7a8080'>[like a boxer]</font> I buffet my body <font color='#7a8080'>[handle it roughly, discipline it by hardships]</font> and subdue it, for fear that after proclaiming to others the Gospel <i>and</i> things pertaining to it, I myself should become unfit <font color='#7a8080'>[not stand the test, be unapproved and rejected as a counterfeit]</font>.

<h4>10</h4>
<p><sup>1</sup> For I do not want you to be ignorant, brethren, that our forefathers were all under <i>and</i> protected by the cloud <font color='#7a8080'>[in which God's Presence went before them]</font>, and every one of them passed safely through the <font color='#7a8080'>[Red]</font> Sea,

<p><sup>2</sup> And each one of them <font color='#7a8080'>[allowed himself also]</font> to be baptized into Moses in the cloud and in the sea <font color='#7a8080'>[they were thus brought under obligation to the Law, to Moses, and to the covenant, consecrated and set apart to the service of God]</font>;

<p><sup>3</sup> And all <font color='#7a8080'>[of them]</font> ate the same spiritual (supernaturally given) food,

<p><sup>4</sup> And they all drank the same spiritual (supernaturally given) drink. For they drank from a spiritual Rock which followed them <font color='#7a8080'>[produced by the sole power of God Himself without natural instrumentality]</font>, and the Rock was Christ.

<p><sup>5</sup> Nevertheless, God was not pleased with the great majority of them, for they were overthrown <i>and</i> strewn down along <font color='#7a8080'>[the ground]</font> in the wilderness.

<p><sup>6</sup> Now these things are examples (warnings and admonitions) for us not to desire <i>or</i> crave <i>or</i> covet <i>or</i> lust after evil <i>and</i> carnal things as they did.

<p><sup>7</sup> Do not be worshipers of false gods as some of them were, as it is written, The people sat down to eat and drink <font color='#7a8080'>[the sacrifices offered to the golden calf at Horeb]</font> and rose to sport (to dance and give way to jesting and hilarity).

<p><sup>8</sup> We must not gratify evil desire <i>and</i> indulge in immorality as some of them did—and twenty-three thousand <font color='#7a8080'>[suddenly]</font> fell <i>dead</i> in a single day!

<p><sup>9</sup> We should not tempt the Lord <font color='#7a8080'>[try His patience, become a trial to Him, critically appraise Him, and exploit His goodness]</font> as some of them did—and were killed by poisonous serpents;

<p><sup>10</sup> Nor discontentedly complain as some of them did—and were put out of the way entirely by the destroyer (death).

<p><sup>11</sup> Now these things befell them by way of a figure <font color='#7a8080'>[as an example and warning to us]</font>; they were written to admonish <i>and</i> fit us for right action by good instruction, we in whose days the ages have reached their climax (their consummation and concluding period).

<p><sup>12</sup> Therefore let anyone who thinks he stands <font color='#7a8080'>[who feels sure that he has a steadfast mind and is standing firm]</font>, take heed lest he fall <font color='#7a8080'>[into sin]</font>.

<p><sup>13</sup> For no temptation (no trial regarded as enticing to sin), <font color='#7a8080'>[no matter how it comes or where it leads]</font> has overtaken you <i>and</i> laid hold on you that is not common to man <font color='#7a8080'>[that is, no temptation or trial has come to you that is beyond human resistance and that is not adjusted and adapted and belonging to human experience, and such as man can bear]</font>. But God is faithful <font color='#7a8080'>[to His Word and to His compassionate nature]</font>, and He <font color='#7a8080'>[can be trusted]</font> not to let you be tempted <i>and</i> tried <i>and</i> assayed beyond your ability <i>and</i> strength of resistance <i>and</i> power to endure, but with the temptation He will <font color='#7a8080'>[always]</font> also provide the way out (the means of escape to a landing place), that you may be capable <i>and</i> strong <i>and</i> powerful to bear up under it patiently.

<p><sup>14</sup> Therefore, my dearly beloved, shun (keep clear away from, avoid by flight if need be) any sort of idolatry (of loving or venerating anything more than God).

<p><sup>15</sup> I am speaking as to intelligent (sensible) men. Think over <i>and</i> make up your minds <font color='#7a8080'>[for yourselves]</font> about what I say. <font color='#7a8080'>[I appeal to your reason and your discernment in these matters.]</font>

<p><sup>16</sup> The cup of blessing <font color='#7a8080'>[of wine at the Lord's Supper]</font> upon which we ask <font color='#7a8080'>[God's]</font> blessing, does it not mean <font color='#7a8080'>[that in drinking it]</font> we participate in <i>and</i> share a fellowship (a communion) in the blood of Christ (the Messiah)? The bread which we break, does it not mean <font color='#7a8080'>[that in eating it]</font> we participate in <i>and</i> share a fellowship (a communion) in the body of Christ?

<p><sup>17</sup> For we <font color='#7a8080'>[no matter how]</font> numerous we are, are one body, because we all partake of the one Bread <font color='#7a8080'>[the One Whom the communion bread represents]</font>.

<p><sup>18</sup> Consider those <font color='#7a8080'>[physically]</font> people of Israel. Are not those who eat the sacrifices partners of the altar <font color='#7a8080'>[united in their worship of the same God]</font>?

<p><sup>19</sup> What do I imply then? That food offered to idols is <font color='#7a8080'>[intrinsically changed by the fact and amounts to]</font> anything <i>or</i> that an idol itself is a <font color='#7a8080'>[living]</font> thing?

<p><sup>20</sup> No, I am suggesting that what the pagans sacrifice they offer <font color='#7a8080'>[in effect]</font> to demons (to evil spiritual powers) and not to God <font color='#7a8080'>[at all]</font>. I do not want you to fellowship <i>and</i> be partners with diabolical spirits <font color='#7a8080'>[by eating at their feasts]</font>.

<p><sup>21</sup> You cannot drink the Lord's cup and the demons' cup. You cannot partake of the Lord's table and the demons' table.

<p><sup>22</sup> Shall we thus provoke the Lord to jealousy <i>and</i> anger <i>and</i> indignation? Are we stronger than He <font color='#7a8080'>[that we should defy Him]</font>?

<p><sup>23</sup> All things are legitimate <font color='#7a8080'>[permissible—and we are free to do anything we please]</font>, but not all things are helpful (expedient, profitable, and wholesome). All things are legitimate, but not all things are constructive <font color='#7a8080'>[to character]</font> <i>and</i> edifying <font color='#7a8080'>[to spiritual life]</font>.

<p><sup>24</sup> Let no one then seek his own good <i>and</i> advantage <i>and</i> profit, but <font color='#7a8080'>[rather]</font> each one of the other <font color='#7a8080'>[let him seek the welfare of his neighbor]</font>.

<p><sup>25</sup> <font color='#7a8080'>[As to meat offered to idols]</font> eat anything that is sold in the meat market without raising any question <i>or</i> investigating on the grounds of conscientious scruples,

<p><sup>26</sup> For the <font color='#7a8080'>[whole]</font> earth is the Lord's and everything that is in it.

<p><sup>27</sup> In case one of the unbelievers invites you to a meal and you want to go, eat whatever is served to you without examining into its source because of conscientious scruples.

<p><sup>28</sup> But if someone tells you, This has been offered in sacrifice to an idol, do not eat it, out of consideration for the person who informed you, and for conscience's sake—

<p><sup>29</sup> I mean for the sake of his conscience, not yours, <font color='#7a8080'>[do not eat it]</font>. For why should another man's scruples apply to me <i>and</i> my liberty of action be determined by his conscience?

<p><sup>30</sup> If I partake <font color='#7a8080'>[of my food]</font> with thankfulness, why am I accused <i>and</i> spoken evil of because of that for which I give thanks?

<p><sup>31</sup> So then, whether you eat or drink, or whatever you may do, do all for the honor <i>and</i> glory of God.

<p><sup>32</sup> Do not let yourselves be <font color='#7a8080'>[hindrances by giving]</font> an offense to the Jews or to the Greeks or to the church of God <font color='#7a8080'>[do not lead others into sin by your mode of life]</font>;

<p><sup>33</sup> Just as I myself strive to please <font color='#7a8080'>[to accommodate myself to the opinions, desires, and interests of others, adapting myself to]</font> all men in everything I do, not aiming at <i>or</i> considering my own profit <i>and</i> advantage, but that of the many in order that they may be saved.

<h4>11</h4>
<p><sup>1</sup> Pattern yourselves after me <font color='#7a8080'>[follow my example]</font>, as I imitate <i>and</i> follow Christ (the Messiah).

<p><sup>2</sup> I appreciate <i>and</i> commend you because you always remember me in everything and keep firm possession of the traditions (the substance of my instructions), just as I have <font color='#7a8080'>[verbally]</font> passed them on to you.

<p><sup>3</sup> But I want you to know <i>and</i> realize that Christ is the Head of every man, the head of a woman is her husband, and the Head of Christ is God.

<p><sup>4</sup> Any man who prays or prophesies (teaches, refutes, reproves, admonishes, and comforts) with his head covered dishonors his Head (Christ).

<p><sup>5</sup> And any woman who <font color='#7a8080'>[publicly]</font> prays or prophesies (teaches, refutes, reproves, admonishes, or comforts) when she is bareheaded dishonors her head (her husband); it is the same as <font color='#7a8080'>[if her head were]</font> shaved.

<p><sup>6</sup> For if a woman will not wear <font color='#7a8080'>[a head]</font> covering, then she should cut off her hair too; but if it is disgraceful for a woman to have her head shorn or shaven, let her cover <font color='#7a8080'>[her head]</font>.

<p><sup>7</sup> For a man ought not to wear anything on his head <font color='#7a8080'>[in church]</font>, for he is the image and <font color='#7a8080'>[reflected]</font> glory of God <font color='#7a8080'>[his function of government reflects the majesty of the divine Rule]</font>; but woman is <font color='#7a8080'>[the expression of]</font> man's glory (majesty, preeminence).

<p><sup>8</sup> For man was not <font color='#7a8080'>[created]</font> from woman, but woman from man;

<p><sup>9</sup> Neither was man created on account of <i>or</i> for the benefit of woman, but woman on account of <i>and</i> for the benefit of man.

<p><sup>10</sup> Therefore she should <font color='#7a8080'>[be subject to his authority and should]</font> have a covering on her head <font color='#7a8080'>[as a token, a symbol, of her submission to authority, that she may show reverence as do]</font> the angels <font color='#7a8080'>[and not displease them]</font>.

<p><sup>11</sup> Nevertheless, in <font color='#7a8080'>[the plan of]</font> the Lord <i>and</i> from His point of view woman is not apart from <i>and</i> independent of man, nor is man aloof from <i>and</i> independent of woman;

<p><sup>12</sup> For as woman was made from man, even so man is also born of woman; and all <font color='#7a8080'>[whether male or female go forth]</font> from God <font color='#7a8080'>[as their Author]</font>.

<p><sup>13</sup> Consider for yourselves; is it proper <i>and</i> decent <font color='#7a8080'>[according to your customs]</font> for a woman to offer prayer to God <font color='#7a8080'>[publicly]</font> with her head uncovered?

<p><sup>14</sup> Does not the native sense of propriety (experience, common sense, reason) itself teach you that for a man to wear long hair is a dishonor <font color='#7a8080'>[humiliating and degrading]</font> to him,

<p><sup>15</sup> But if a woman has long hair, it is her ornament <i>and</i> glory? For her hair is given to her for a covering.

<p><sup>16</sup> Now if anyone is disposed to be argumentative <i>and</i> contentious about this, we hold to <i>and</i> recognize no other custom <font color='#7a8080'>[in worship]</font> than this, nor do the churches of God generally.

<p><sup>17</sup> But in what I instruct <font color='#7a8080'>[you]</font> next I do not commend <font color='#7a8080'>[you]</font>, because when you meet together, it is not for the better but for the worse.

<p><sup>18</sup> For in the first place, when you assemble as a congregation, I hear that there are cliques (divisions and factions) among you; and I in part believe it,

<p><sup>19</sup> For doubtless there have to be factions <i>or</i> parties among you in order that they who are genuine <i>and</i> of approved fitness may become evident <i>and</i> plainly recognized among you.

<p><sup>20</sup> So when you gather for your meetings, it is not the supper instituted by the Lord that you eat,

<p><sup>21</sup> For in eating each one <font color='#7a8080'>[hurries]</font> to get his own supper first <font color='#7a8080'>[not waiting for the poor]</font>, and one goes hungry while another gets drunk.

<p><sup>22</sup> What! Do you have no houses in which to eat and drink? Or do you despise the church of God <i>and</i> mean to show contempt for it, while you humiliate those who are poor (have no homes and have brought no food)? What shall I say to you? Shall I commend you in this? No, <font color='#7a8080'>[most certainly]</font> I will not!

<p><sup>23</sup> For I received from the Lord Himself that which I passed on to you <font color='#7a8080'>[it was given to me personally]</font>, that the Lord Jesus on the night when He was treacherously delivered up <i>and</i> while His betrayal was in progress took bread,

<p><sup>24</sup> And when He had given thanks, He broke <font color='#7a8080'>[it]</font> and said, <i>Take, eat</i>. This is My body, which is broken for you. Do this to call Me <font color='#7a8080'>[affectionately]</font> to remembrance.

<p><sup>25</sup> Similarly when supper was ended, He took the cup also, saying, This cup is the new covenant <font color='#7a8080'>[ratified and established]</font> in My blood. Do this, as often as you drink <font color='#7a8080'>[it]</font>, to call Me <font color='#7a8080'>[affectionately]</font> to remembrance.

<p><sup>26</sup> For every time you eat this bread and drink this cup, you are representing <i>and</i> signifying <i>and</i> proclaiming the fact of the Lord's death until He comes <font color='#7a8080'>[again]</font>.

<p><sup>27</sup> So then whoever eats the bread or drinks the cup of the Lord in a way that is unworthy <font color='#7a8080'>[of Him]</font> will be guilty of <font color='#7a8080'>[profaning and sinning against]</font> the body and blood of the Lord.

<p><sup>28</sup> Let a man <font color='#7a8080'>[thoroughly]</font> examine himself, and <font color='#7a8080'>[only when he has done]</font> so should he eat of the bread and drink of the cup.

<p><sup>29</sup> For anyone who eats and drinks without discriminating <i>and</i> recognizing with due appreciation that <font color='#7a8080'>[it is Christ's]</font> body, eats and drinks a sentence (a verdict of judgment) upon himself.

<p><sup>30</sup> That <font color='#7a8080'>[careless and unworthy participation]</font> is the reason many of you are weak and sickly, and quite enough of you have fallen into the sleep of death.

<p><sup>31</sup> For if we searchingly examined ourselves <font color='#7a8080'>[detecting our shortcomings and recognizing our own condition]</font>, we should not be judged <i>and</i> penalty decreed <font color='#7a8080'>[by the divine judgment]</font>.

<p><sup>32</sup> But when we <font color='#7a8080'>[fall short and]</font> are judged by the Lord, we are disciplined <i>and</i> chastened, so that we may not <font color='#7a8080'>[finally]</font> be condemned <font color='#7a8080'>[to eternal punishment along]</font> with the world.

<p><sup>33</sup> So then, my brothers, when you gather together to eat <font color='#7a8080'>[the Lord's Supper]</font>, wait for one another.

<p><sup>34</sup> If anyone is hungry, let him eat at home, lest you come together to bring judgment <font color='#7a8080'>[on yourselves]</font>. About the other matters, I will give you directions <font color='#7a8080'>[personally]</font> when I come.

<h4>12</h4>
<p><sup>1</sup> Now about the spiritual gifts (the special endowments of supernatural energy), brethren, I do not want you to be misinformed.

<p><sup>2</sup> You know that when you were heathen, you were led off after idols that could not speak <font color='#7a8080'>[habitually]</font> as impulse directed <i>and</i> whenever the occasion might arise.

<p><sup>3</sup> Therefore I want you to understand that no one speaking under the power <i>and</i> influence of the <font color='#7a8080'>[Holy]</font> Spirit of God can <font color='#7a8080'>[ever]</font> say, Jesus be cursed! And no one can <font color='#7a8080'>[really]</font> say, Jesus is <font color='#7a8080'>[my]</font> Lord, except by <i>and</i> under the power <i>and</i> influence of the Holy Spirit.

<p><sup>4</sup> Now there are distinctive varieties <i>and</i> distributions of endowments (gifts, extraordinary powers distinguishing certain Christians, due to the power of divine grace operating in their souls by the Holy Spirit) and they vary, but the <font color='#7a8080'>[Holy]</font> Spirit remains the same.

<p><sup>5</sup> And there are distinctive varieties of service <i>and</i> ministration, but it is the same Lord <font color='#7a8080'>[Who is served]</font>.

<p><sup>6</sup> And there are distinctive varieties of operation <font color='#7a8080'>[of working to accomplish things]</font>, but it is the same God Who inspires <i>and</i> energizes them all in all.

<p><sup>7</sup> But to each one is given the manifestation of the <font color='#7a8080'>[Holy]</font> Spirit <font color='#7a8080'>[the evidence, the spiritual illumination of the Spirit]</font> for good <i>and</i> profit.

<p><sup>8</sup> To one is given in <i>and</i> through the <font color='#7a8080'>[Holy]</font> Spirit <font color='#7a8080'>[the power to speak]</font> a message of wisdom, and to another <font color='#7a8080'>[the power to express]</font> a word of knowledge <i>and</i> understanding according to the same <font color='#7a8080'>[Holy]</font> Spirit;

<p><sup>9</sup> To another <font color='#7a8080'>[wonder-working]</font> faith by the same <font color='#7a8080'>[Holy]</font> Spirit, to another the extraordinary powers of healing by the one Spirit;

<p><sup>10</sup> To another the working of miracles, to another prophetic insight (the gift of interpreting the divine will and purpose); to another the ability to discern <i>and</i> distinguish between <font color='#7a8080'>[the utterances of true]</font> spirits <font color='#7a8080'>[and false ones]</font>, to another various kinds of <font color='#7a8080'>[unknown]</font> tongues, to another the ability to interpret <font color='#7a8080'>[such]</font> tongues.

<p><sup>11</sup> All these <font color='#7a8080'>[gifts, achievements, abilities]</font> are inspired <i>and</i> brought to pass by one and the same <font color='#7a8080'>[Holy]</font> Spirit, Who apportions to each person individually <font color='#7a8080'>[exactly]</font> as He chooses.

<p><sup>12</sup> For just as the body is a unity and yet has many parts, and all the parts, though many, form <font color='#7a8080'>[only]</font> one body, so it is with Christ (the Messiah, the Anointed One).

<p><sup>13</sup> For by <font color='#7a8080'>[means of the personal agency of]</font> one <font color='#7a8080'>[Holy]</font> Spirit we were all, whether Jews or Greeks, slaves or free, baptized <font color='#7a8080'>[and by baptism united together]</font> into one body, and all made to drink of one <font color='#7a8080'>[Holy]</font> Spirit.

<p><sup>14</sup> For the body does not consist of one limb <i>or</i> organ but of many.

<p><sup>15</sup> If the foot should say, Because I am not the hand, I do not belong to the body, would it be therefore not <font color='#7a8080'>[a part]</font> of the body?

<p><sup>16</sup> If the ear should say, Because I am not the eye, I do not belong to the body, would it be therefore not <font color='#7a8080'>[a part]</font> of the body?

<p><sup>17</sup> If the whole body were an eye, where <font color='#7a8080'>[would be the sense of]</font> hearing? If the whole body were an ear, where <font color='#7a8080'>[would be the sense of]</font> smell?

<p><sup>18</sup> But as it is, God has placed <i>and</i> arranged the limbs <i>and</i> organs in the body, each <font color='#7a8080'>[particular one]</font> of them, just as He wished <i>and</i> saw fit <i>and</i> with the best adaptation.

<p><sup>19</sup> But if <font color='#7a8080'>[the whole]</font> were all a single organ, where would the body be?

<p><sup>20</sup> And now there are <font color='#7a8080'>[certainly]</font> many limbs <i>and</i> organs, but a single body.

<p><sup>21</sup> And the eye is not able to say to the hand, I have no need of you, nor again the head to the feet, I have no need of you.

<p><sup>22</sup> But instead, there is <font color='#7a8080'>[absolute]</font> necessity for the parts of the body that are considered the more weak.

<p><sup>23</sup> And those <font color='#7a8080'>[parts]</font> of the body which we consider rather ignoble are <font color='#7a8080'>[the very parts]</font> which we invest with additional honor, and our unseemly parts <i>and</i> those unsuitable for exposure are treated with seemliness (modesty and decorum),

<p><sup>24</sup> Which our more presentable parts do not require. But God has so adjusted (mingled, harmonized, and subtly proportioned the parts of) the whole body, giving the greater honor <i>and</i> richer endowment to the inferior parts which lack <font color='#7a8080'>[apparent importance]</font>,

<p><sup>25</sup> So that there should be no division <i>or</i> discord <i>or</i> lack of adaptation <font color='#7a8080'>[of the parts of the body to each other]</font>, but the members all alike should have a mutual interest in <i>and</i> care for one another.

<p><sup>26</sup> And if one member suffers, all the parts <font color='#7a8080'>[share]</font> the suffering; if one member is honored, all the members <font color='#7a8080'>[share in]</font> the enjoyment of it.

<p><sup>27</sup> Now you <font color='#7a8080'>[collectively]</font> are Christ's body and <font color='#7a8080'>[individually]</font> you are members of it, each part severally <i>and</i> distinct <font color='#7a8080'>[each with his own place and function]</font>.

<p><sup>28</sup> So God has appointed some in the church <font color='#7a8080'>[for His own use]</font>: first apostles (special messengers); second prophets (inspired preachers and expounders); third teachers; then wonder-workers; then those with ability to heal the sick; helpers; administrators; <font color='#7a8080'>[speakers in]</font> different (unknown) tongues.

<p><sup>29</sup> Are all apostles (special messengers)? Are all prophets (inspired interpreters of the will and purposes of God)? Are all teachers? Do all have the power of performing miracles?

<p><sup>30</sup> Do all possess extraordinary powers of healing? Do all speak with tongues? Do all interpret?

<p><sup>31</sup> But earnestly desire <i>and</i> zealously cultivate the greatest <i>and</i> best gifts <i>and</i> graces (the higher gifts and the choicest graces). And yet I will show you a still more excellent way <font color='#7a8080'>[one that is better by far and the highest of them all—love]</font>.

<h4>13</h4>
<p><sup>1</sup> If I <font color='#7a8080'>[can]</font> speak in the tongues of men and <font color='#7a8080'>[even]</font> of angels, but have not love (that reasoning, intentional, spiritual devotion such as is inspired by God's love for and in us), I am only a noisy gong or a clanging cymbal.

<p><sup>2</sup> And if I have prophetic powers (the gift of interpreting the divine will and purpose), and understand all the secret truths <i>and</i> mysteries and possess all knowledge, and if I have <font color='#7a8080'>[sufficient]</font> faith so that I can remove mountains, but have not love (God's love in me) I am nothing (a useless nobody).

<p><sup>3</sup> Even if I dole out all that I have <font color='#7a8080'>[to the poor in providing]</font> food, and if I surrender my body to be burned <i>or</i> <i>in order that I may glory</i>, but have not love (God's love in me), I gain nothing.

<p><sup>4</sup> Love endures long <i>and</i> is patient and kind; love never is envious <i>nor</i> boils over with jealousy, is not boastful <i>or</i> vainglorious, does not display itself haughtily.

<p><sup>5</sup> It is not conceited (arrogant and inflated with pride); it is not rude (unmannerly) <i>and</i> does not act unbecomingly. Love (God's love in us) does not insist on its own rights <i>or</i> its own way, <i>for</i> it is not self-seeking; it is not touchy <i>or</i> fretful <i>or</i> resentful; it takes no account of the evil done to it <font color='#7a8080'>[it pays no attention to a suffered wrong]</font>.

<p><sup>6</sup> It does not rejoice at injustice <i>and</i> unrighteousness, but rejoices when right <i>and</i> truth prevail.

<p><sup>7</sup> Love bears up under anything <i>and</i> everything that comes, is ever ready to believe the best of every person, its hopes are fadeless under all circumstances, and it endures everything <font color='#7a8080'>[without weakening]</font>.

<p><sup>8</sup> Love never fails <font color='#7a8080'>[never fades out or becomes obsolete or comes to an end]</font>. As for prophecy (the gift of interpreting the divine will and purpose), it will be fulfilled <i>and</i> pass away; as for tongues, they will be destroyed <i>and</i> cease; as for knowledge, it will pass away <font color='#7a8080'>[it will lose its value and be superseded by truth]</font>.

<p><sup>9</sup> For our knowledge is fragmentary (incomplete and imperfect), and our prophecy (our teaching) is fragmentary (incomplete and imperfect).

<p><sup>10</sup> But when the complete <i>and</i> perfect (total) comes, the incomplete <i>and</i> imperfect will vanish away (become antiquated, void, and superseded).

<p><sup>11</sup> When I was a child, I talked like a child, I thought like a child, I reasoned like a child; now that I have become a man, I am done with childish ways <i>and</i> have put them aside.

<p><sup>12</sup> For now we are looking in a mirror that gives only a dim (blurred) reflection <font color='#7a8080'>[of reality as in a riddle or enigma]</font>, but then <font color='#7a8080'>[when perfection comes]</font> we shall see in reality <i>and</i> face to face! Now I know in part (imperfectly), but then I shall know <i>and</i> understand fully <i>and</i> clearly, even in the same manner as I have been fully <i>and</i> clearly known <i>and</i> understood <font color='#7a8080'>[by God]</font>.

<p><sup>13</sup> And so faith, hope, love abide <font color='#7a8080'>[faith—conviction and belief respecting man's relation to God and divine things; hope—joyful and confident expectation of eternal salvation; love—true affection for God and man, growing out of God's love for and in us]</font>, these three; but the greatest of these is love.

<h4>14</h4>
<p><sup>1</sup> Eagerly pursue <i>and</i> seek to acquire <font color='#7a8080'>[this]</font> love <font color='#7a8080'>[make it your aim, your great quest]</font>; and earnestly desire <i>and</i> cultivate the spiritual endowments (gifts), especially that you may prophesy (interpret the divine will and purpose in inspired preaching and teaching).

<p><sup>2</sup> For one who speaks in an <font color='#7a8080'>[unknown]</font> tongue speaks not to men but to God, for no one understands <i>or</i> catches his meaning, because in the <font color='#7a8080'>[Holy]</font> Spirit he utters secret truths <i>and</i> hidden things <font color='#7a8080'>[not obvious to the understanding]</font>.

<p><sup>3</sup> But <font color='#7a8080'>[on the other hand]</font>, the one who prophesies <font color='#7a8080'>[who interprets the divine will and purpose in inspired preaching and teaching]</font> speaks to men for their upbuilding <i>and</i> constructive spiritual progress and encouragement and consolation.

<p><sup>4</sup> He who speaks in a <font color='#7a8080'>[strange]</font> tongue edifies <i>and</i> improves himself, but he who prophesies <font color='#7a8080'>[interpreting the divine will and purpose and teaching with inspiration]</font> edifies <i>and</i> improves the church <i>and</i> promotes growth <font color='#7a8080'>[in Christian wisdom, piety, holiness, and happiness]</font>.

<p><sup>5</sup> Now I wish that you might all speak in <font color='#7a8080'>[unknown]</font> tongues, but more especially <font color='#7a8080'>[I want you]</font> to prophesy (to be inspired to preach and interpret the divine will and purpose). He who prophesies <font color='#7a8080'>[who is inspired to preach and teach]</font> is greater (more useful and more important) than he who speaks in <font color='#7a8080'>[unknown]</font> tongues, unless he should interpret <font color='#7a8080'>[what he says]</font>, so that the church may be edified <i>and</i> receive good <font color='#7a8080'>[from it]</font>.

<p><sup>6</sup> Now, brethren, if I come to you speaking in <font color='#7a8080'>[unknown]</font> tongues, how shall I make it to your advantage unless I speak to you either in revelation (disclosure of God's will to man) in knowledge or in prophecy or in instruction?

<p><sup>7</sup> If even inanimate musical instruments, such as the flute or the harp, do not give distinct notes, how will anyone <font color='#7a8080'>[listening]</font> know <i>or</i> understand what is played?

<p><sup>8</sup> And if the war bugle gives an uncertain (indistinct) call, who will prepare for battle?

<p><sup>9</sup> Just so it is with you; if you in the <font color='#7a8080'>[unknown]</font> tongue speak words that are not intelligible, how will anyone understand what you are saying? For you will be talking into empty space!

<p><sup>10</sup> There are, I suppose, all these many <font color='#7a8080'>[to us unknown]</font> tongues in the world <font color='#7a8080'>[somewhere]</font>, and none is destitute of <font color='#7a8080'>[its own power of]</font> expression <i>and</i> meaning.

<p><sup>11</sup> But if I do not know the force <i>and</i> significance of the speech (language), I shall seem to be a foreigner to the one who speaks <font color='#7a8080'>[to me]</font>, and the speaker who addresses <font color='#7a8080'>[me]</font> will seem a foreigner to me.

<p><sup>12</sup> So it is with yourselves; since you are so eager <i>and</i> ambitious to possess spiritual endowments <i>and</i> manifestations of the <font color='#7a8080'>[Holy]</font> Spirit, <font color='#7a8080'>[concentrate on]</font> striving to excel <i>and</i> to abound <font color='#7a8080'>[in them]</font> in ways that will build up the church.

<p><sup>13</sup> Therefore, the person who speaks in an <font color='#7a8080'>[unknown]</font> tongue should pray <font color='#7a8080'>[for the power]</font> to interpret <i>and</i> explain what he says.

<p><sup>14</sup> For if I pray in an <font color='#7a8080'>[unknown]</font> tongue, my spirit <font color='#7a8080'>[by the Holy Spirit within me]</font> prays, but my mind is unproductive <font color='#7a8080'>[it bears no fruit and helps nobody]</font>.

<p><sup>15</sup> Then what am I to do? I will pray with my spirit <font color='#7a8080'>[by the Holy Spirit that is within me]</font>, but I will also pray <font color='#7a8080'>[intelligently]</font> with my mind <i>and</i> understanding; I will sing with my spirit <font color='#7a8080'>[by the Holy Spirit that is within me]</font>, but I will sing <font color='#7a8080'>[intelligently]</font> with my mind <i>and</i> understanding also.

<p><sup>16</sup> Otherwise, if you bless <i>and</i> render thanks with <font color='#7a8080'>[your]</font> spirit <font color='#7a8080'>[thoroughly aroused by the Holy Spirit]</font>, how can anyone in the position of an outsider <i>or</i> he who is not gifted with <font color='#7a8080'>[interpreting of unknown]</font> tongues, say the Amen to your thanksgiving, since he does not know what you are saying?

<p><sup>17</sup> To be sure, you may give thanks well (nobly), but the bystander is not edified <font color='#7a8080'>[it does him no good]</font>.

<p><sup>18</sup> I thank God that I speak in <font color='#7a8080'>[strange]</font> tongues (languages) more than any of you <i>or</i> all of you put together;

<p><sup>19</sup> Nevertheless, in public worship, I would rather say five words with my understanding <i>and</i> intelligently in order to instruct others, than ten thousand words in a <font color='#7a8080'>[strange]</font> tongue (language).

<p><sup>20</sup> Brethren, do not be children <font color='#7a8080'>[immature]</font> in your thinking; continue to be babes in <font color='#7a8080'>[matters of]</font> evil, but in your minds be mature <font color='#7a8080'>[men]</font>.

<p><sup>21</sup> It is written in the Law, By men of strange languages <i>and</i> by the lips of foreigners will I speak to this people, and not even then will they listen to Me, says the Lord.

<p><sup>22</sup> Thus <font color='#7a8080'>[unknown]</font> tongues are meant for a <font color='#7a8080'>[supernatural]</font> sign, not for believers but for unbelievers <font color='#7a8080'>[on the point of believing]</font>, while prophecy (inspired preaching and teaching, interpreting the divine will and purpose) is not for unbelievers <font color='#7a8080'>[on the point of believing]</font> but for believers.

<p><sup>23</sup> Therefore, if the whole church assembles and all of you speak in <font color='#7a8080'>[unknown]</font> tongues, and the ungifted <i>and</i> uninitiated or unbelievers come in, will they not say that you are demented?

<p><sup>24</sup> But if all prophesy <font color='#7a8080'>[giving inspired testimony and interpreting the divine will and purpose]</font> and an unbeliever or untaught outsider comes in, he is told of his sin <i>and</i> reproved <i>and</i> convicted <i>and</i> convinced by all, and his defects <i>and</i> needs are examined (estimated, determined) <i>and</i> he is called to account by all,

<p><sup>25</sup> The secrets of his heart are laid bare; and so, falling on <font color='#7a8080'>[his]</font> face, he will worship God, declaring that God is among you in very truth.

<p><sup>26</sup> What then, brethren, is <font color='#7a8080'>[the right course]</font>? When you meet together, each one has a hymn, a teaching, a disclosure of special knowledge <i>or</i> information, an utterance in a <font color='#7a8080'>[strange]</font> tongue, or an interpretation of it. <font color='#7a8080'>[But]</font> let everything be constructive <i>and</i> edifying <i>and</i> for the good of all.

<p><sup>27</sup> If some speak in a <font color='#7a8080'>[strange]</font> tongue, let the number be limited to two or at the most three, and each one <font color='#7a8080'>[taking his]</font> turn, and let one interpret <i>and</i> explain <font color='#7a8080'>[what is said]</font>.

<p><sup>28</sup> But if there is no one to do the interpreting, let each of them keep still in church and talk to himself and to God.

<p><sup>29</sup> So let two or three prophets speak <font color='#7a8080'>[those inspired to preach or teach]</font>, while the rest pay attention <i>and</i> weigh <i>and</i> discern what is said.

<p><sup>30</sup> But if an inspired revelation comes to another who is sitting by, then let the first one be silent.

<p><sup>31</sup> For in this way you can give testimony <font color='#7a8080'>[prophesying and thus interpreting the divine will and purpose]</font> one by one, so that all may be instructed and all may be stimulated <i>and</i> encouraged;

<p><sup>32</sup> For the spirits of the prophets (the speakers in tongues) are under the speaker's control <font color='#7a8080'>[and subject to being silenced as may be necessary]</font>,

<p><sup>33</sup> For He <font color='#7a8080'>[Who is the source of their prophesying]</font> is not a God of confusion <i>and</i> disorder but of peace <i>and</i> order. As <font color='#7a8080'>[is the practice]</font> in all the churches of the saints (God's people),

<p><sup>34</sup> The women should keep quiet in the churches, for they are not authorized to speak, but should take a secondary <i>and</i> subordinate place, just as the Law also says.

<p><sup>35</sup> But if there is anything they want to learn, they should ask their own husbands at home, for it is disgraceful for a woman to talk in church <font color='#7a8080'>[for her to usurp and exercise authority over men in the church]</font>.

<p><sup>36</sup> What! Did the word of the Lord originate with you <font color='#7a8080'>[Corinthians]</font>, or has it reached only you?

<p><sup>37</sup> If anyone thinks <i>and</i> claims that he is a prophet <font color='#7a8080'>[filled with and governed by the Holy Spirit of God and inspired to interpret the divine will and purpose in preaching or teaching]</font> or has any other spiritual endowment, let him understand (recognize and acknowledge) that what I am writing to you is a command of the Lord.

<p><sup>38</sup> But if anyone disregards <i>or</i> does not recognize <font color='#7a8080'>[that it is a command of the Lord]</font>, he is disregarded <i>and</i> not recognized <font color='#7a8080'>[he is one whom God knows not]</font>.

<p><sup>39</sup> So <font color='#7a8080'>[to conclude]</font>, my brethren, earnestly desire <i>and</i> set your hearts on prophesying (on being inspired to preach and teach and to interpret God's will and purpose), and do not forbid <i>or</i> hinder speaking in <font color='#7a8080'>[unknown]</font> tongues.

<p><sup>40</sup> But all things should be done with regard to decency <i>and</i> propriety and in an orderly fashion.

<h4>15</h4>
<p><sup>1</sup> And now let me remind you <font color='#7a8080'>[since it seems to have escaped you]</font>, brethren, of the Gospel (the glad tidings of salvation) which I proclaimed to you, which you welcomed <i>and</i> accepted and upon which your faith rests,

<p><sup>2</sup> And by which you are saved, if you hold fast <i>and</i> keep firmly what I preached to you, unless you believed at first without effect <i>and</i> all for nothing.

<p><sup>3</sup> For I passed on to you first of all what I also had received, that Christ (the Messiah, the Anointed One) died for our sins in accordance with <font color='#7a8080'>[what]</font> the Scriptures <font color='#7a8080'>[foretold]</font>,

<p><sup>4</sup> That He was buried, that He arose on the third day as the Scriptures foretold,

<p><sup>5</sup> And <font color='#7a8080'>[also]</font> that He appeared to Cephas (Peter), then to the Twelve.

<p><sup>6</sup> Then later He showed Himself to more than five hundred brethren at one time, the majority of whom are still alive, but some have fallen asleep <font color='#7a8080'>[in death]</font>.

<p><sup>7</sup> Afterward He was seen by James, then by all the apostles (the special messengers),

<p><sup>8</sup> And last of all He appeared to me also, as to one prematurely <i>and</i> born dead <font color='#7a8080'>[no better than an unperfected fetus among living men]</font>.

<p><sup>9</sup> For I am the least <font color='#7a8080'>[worthy]</font> of the apostles, who am not fit <i>or</i> deserving to be called an apostle, because I once wronged <i>and</i> pursued <i>and</i> molested the church of God <font color='#7a8080'>[oppressing it with cruelty and violence]</font>.

<p><sup>10</sup> But by the grace (the unmerited favor and blessing) of God I am what I am, and His grace toward me was not <font color='#7a8080'>[found to be]</font> for nothing (fruitless and without effect). In fact, I worked harder than all of them <font color='#7a8080'>[the apostles]</font>, though it was not really I, but the grace (the unmerited favor and blessing) of God which was with me.

<p><sup>11</sup> So, whether then it was I or they, this is what we preach and this is what you believed <font color='#7a8080'>[what you adhered to, trusted in, and relied on]</font>.

<p><sup>12</sup> But now if Christ (the Messiah) is preached as raised from the dead, how is it that some of you say that there is no resurrection of the dead?

<p><sup>13</sup> But if there is no resurrection of the dead, then Christ has not risen;

<p><sup>14</sup> And if Christ has not risen, then our preaching is in vain <font color='#7a8080'>[it amounts to nothing]</font> and your faith is devoid of truth <i>and</i> is fruitless (without effect, empty, imaginary, and unfounded).

<p><sup>15</sup> We are even discovered to be misrepresenting God, for we testified of Him that He raised Christ, Whom He did not raise in case it is true that the dead are not raised.

<p><sup>16</sup> For if the dead are not raised, then Christ has not been raised;

<p><sup>17</sup> And if Christ has not been raised, your faith is mere delusion <font color='#7a8080'>[futile, fruitless]</font>, and you are still in your sins <font color='#7a8080'>[under the control and penalty of sin]</font>;

<p><sup>18</sup> And further, those who have died in <font color='#7a8080'>[spiritual fellowship and union with]</font> Christ have perished (are lost)!

<p><sup>19</sup> If we who are <font color='#7a8080'>[abiding]</font> in Christ have hope only in this life <i>and</i> that is all, then we are of all people most miserable <i>and</i> to be pitied.

<p><sup>20</sup> But the fact is that Christ (the Messiah) has been raised from the dead, and He became the firstfruits of those who have fallen asleep <font color='#7a8080'>[in death]</font>.

<p><sup>21</sup> For since <font color='#7a8080'>[it was]</font> through a man that death <font color='#7a8080'>[came into the world, it is]</font> also through a Man that the resurrection of the dead <font color='#7a8080'>[has come]</font>.

<p><sup>22</sup> For just as <font color='#7a8080'>[because of their union of nature]</font> in Adam all people die, so also <font color='#7a8080'>[by virtue of their union of nature]</font> shall all in Christ be made alive.

<p><sup>23</sup> But each in his own rank <i>and</i> turn: Christ (the Messiah) <font color='#7a8080'>[is]</font> the firstfruits, then those who are Christ's <font color='#7a8080'>[own will be resurrected]</font> at His coming.

<p><sup>24</sup> After that comes the end (the completion), when He delivers over the kingdom to God the Father after rendering inoperative <i>and</i> abolishing every <font color='#7a8080'>[other]</font> rule and every authority and power.

<p><sup>25</sup> For <font color='#7a8080'>[Christ]</font> must be King <i>and</i> reign until He has put all <font color='#7a8080'>[His]</font> enemies under His feet.

<p><sup>26</sup> The last enemy to be subdued <i>and</i> abolished is death.

<p><sup>27</sup> For He <font color='#7a8080'>[the Father]</font> has put all things in subjection under His <font color='#7a8080'>[Christ's]</font> feet. But when it says, All things are put in subjection <font color='#7a8080'>[under Him]</font>, it is evident that He <font color='#7a8080'>[Himself]</font> is excepted Who does the subjecting of all things to Him.

<p><sup>28</sup> However, when everything is subjected to Him, then the Son Himself will also subject Himself to <font color='#7a8080'>[the Father]</font> Who put all things under Him, so that God may be all in all <font color='#7a8080'>[be everything to everyone, supreme, the indwelling and controlling factor of life]</font>.

<p><sup>29</sup> Otherwise, what do people mean by being <font color='#7a8080'>[themselves]</font> baptized in behalf of the dead? If the dead are not raised at all, why are people baptized for them?

<p><sup>30</sup> <font color='#7a8080'>[For that matter]</font>, why do I live <font color='#7a8080'>[dangerously as I do, running such risks that I am]</font> in peril every hour?

<p><sup>31</sup> <font color='#7a8080'>[I assure you]</font> by the pride which I have in you in <font color='#7a8080'>[your fellowship and union with]</font> Christ Jesus our Lord, that I die daily <font color='#7a8080'>[I face death every day and die to self]</font>.

<p><sup>32</sup> What do I gain if, merely from the human point of view, I fought with <font color='#7a8080'>[wild]</font> beasts at Ephesus? If the dead are not raised <font color='#7a8080'>[at all]</font>, let us eat and drink, for tomorrow we will be dead.

<p><sup>33</sup> Do not be so deceived <i>and</i> misled! Evil companionships (communion, associations) corrupt <i>and</i> deprave good manners <i>and</i> morals <i>and</i> character.

<p><sup>34</sup> Awake <font color='#7a8080'>[from your drunken stupor and return]</font> to sober sense <i>and</i> your right minds, and sin no more. For some of you have not the knowledge of God <font color='#7a8080'>[you are utterly and willfully and disgracefully ignorant, and continue to be so, lacking the sense of God's presence and all true knowledge of Him]</font>. I say this to your shame.

<p><sup>35</sup> But someone will say, How can the dead be raised? With what <font color='#7a8080'>[kind of]</font> body will they come forth?

<p><sup>36</sup> You foolish man! Every time you plant seed, you sow something that does not come to life <font color='#7a8080'>[germinating, springing up, and growing]</font> unless it dies first.

<p><sup>37</sup> Nor is the seed you sow then the body which it is going to have <font color='#7a8080'>[later]</font>, but it is a naked kernel, perhaps of wheat or some of the rest of the grains.

<p><sup>38</sup> But God gives to it the body that He plans <i>and</i> sees fit, and to each kind of seed a body of its own.

<p><sup>39</sup> For all flesh is not the same, but there is one kind for humans, another for beasts, another for birds, and another for fish.

<p><sup>40</sup> There are heavenly bodies (sun, moon, and stars) and there are earthly bodies (men, animals, and plants), but the beauty <i>and</i> glory of the heavenly bodies is of one kind, while the beauty <i>and</i> glory of earthly bodies is a different kind.

<p><sup>41</sup> The sun is glorious in one way, the moon is glorious in another way, and the stars are glorious in their own <font color='#7a8080'>[distinctive]</font> way; for one star differs from <i>and</i> surpasses another in its beauty <i>and</i> brilliance.

<p><sup>42</sup> So it is with the resurrection of the dead. <font color='#7a8080'>[The body]</font> that is sown is perishable <i>and</i> decays, but <font color='#7a8080'>[the body]</font> that is resurrected is imperishable (immune to decay, immortal).

<p><sup>43</sup> It is sown in dishonor <i>and</i> humiliation; it is raised in honor <i>and</i> glory. It is sown in infirmity <i>and</i> weakness; it is resurrected in strength <i>and</i> endued with power.

<p><sup>44</sup> It is sown a natural (physical) body; it is raised a supernatural (a spiritual) body. <font color='#7a8080'>[As surely as]</font> there is a physical body, there is also a spiritual body.

<p><sup>45</sup> Thus it is written, The first man Adam became a living being (an individual personality); the last Adam (Christ) became a life-giving Spirit <font color='#7a8080'>[restoring the dead to life]</font>.

<p><sup>46</sup> But it is not the spiritual life which came first, but the physical and then the spiritual.

<p><sup>47</sup> The first man <font color='#7a8080'>[was]</font> from out of earth, made of dust (earthly-minded); the second Man <font color='#7a8080'>[is]</font> <i>the Lord</i> from out of heaven.

<p><sup>48</sup> Now those who are made of the dust are like him who was first made of the dust (earthly-minded); and as is <font color='#7a8080'>[the Man]</font> from heaven, so also <font color='#7a8080'>[are those]</font> who are of heaven (heavenly-minded).

<p><sup>49</sup> And just as we have borne the image <font color='#7a8080'>[of the man]</font> of dust, so shall we <i>and so</i> <i>let us</i> also bear the image <font color='#7a8080'>[of the Man]</font> of heaven.

<p><sup>50</sup> But I tell you this, brethren, flesh and blood cannot <font color='#7a8080'>[become partakers of eternal salvation and]</font> inherit <i>or</i> share in the kingdom of God; nor does the perishable (that which is decaying) inherit <i>or</i> share in the imperishable (the immortal).

<p><sup>51</sup> Take notice! I tell you a mystery (a secret truth, an event decreed by the hidden purpose or counsel of God). We shall not all fall asleep <font color='#7a8080'>[in death]</font>, but we shall all be changed (transformed)

<p><sup>52</sup> In a moment, in the twinkling of an eye, at the <font color='#7a8080'>[sound of the]</font> last trumpet call. For a trumpet will sound, and the dead <font color='#7a8080'>[in Christ]</font> will be raised imperishable (free and immune from decay), and we shall be changed (transformed).

<p><sup>53</sup> For this perishable <font color='#7a8080'>[part of us]</font> must put on the imperishable <font color='#7a8080'>[nature]</font>, and this mortal <font color='#7a8080'>[part of us, this nature that is capable of dying]</font> must put on immortality (freedom from death).

<p><sup>54</sup> And when this perishable puts on the imperishable and this that was capable of dying puts on freedom from death, then shall be fulfilled the Scripture that says, Death is swallowed up (utterly vanquished forever) in <i>and</i> unto victory.

<p><sup>55</sup> O death, where is your victory? O death, where is your sting?

<p><sup>56</sup> Now sin is the sting of death, and sin exercises its power <font color='#7a8080'>[upon the soul]</font> through <font color='#7a8080'>[the abuse of]</font> the Law.

<p><sup>57</sup> But thanks be to God, Who gives us the victory <font color='#7a8080'>[making us conquerors]</font> through our Lord Jesus Christ.

<p><sup>58</sup> Therefore, my beloved brethren, be firm (steadfast), immovable, always abounding in the work of the Lord <font color='#7a8080'>[always being superior, excelling, doing more than enough in the service of the Lord]</font>, knowing <i>and</i> being continually aware that your labor in the Lord is not futile <font color='#7a8080'>[it is never wasted or to no purpose]</font>.

<h4>16</h4>
<p><sup>1</sup> Now concerning the money contributed for <font color='#7a8080'>[the relief of]</font> the saints (God's people): you are to do the same as I directed the churches of Galatia to do.

<p><sup>2</sup> On the first <font color='#7a8080'>[day]</font> of each week, let each one of you <font color='#7a8080'>[personally]</font> put aside something and save it up as he has prospered <font color='#7a8080'>[in proportion to what he is given]</font>, so that no collections will need to be taken after I come.

<p><sup>3</sup> And when I arrive, I will send on those whom you approve <i>and</i> authorize with credentials to carry your gift <font color='#7a8080'>[of charity]</font> to Jerusalem.

<p><sup>4</sup> If it seems worthwhile that I should go too, they will accompany me.

<p><sup>5</sup> After passing through Macedonia, I will visit you, for I intend <font color='#7a8080'>[only]</font> to pass through Macedonia;

<p><sup>6</sup> But it may be that I will stay with you <font color='#7a8080'>[for a while]</font>, perhaps even spend the winter, so that you may bring me forward <font color='#7a8080'>[on my journey]</font> to wherever I may go.

<p><sup>7</sup> For I am unwilling to see you right now <font color='#7a8080'>[just]</font> in passing, but I hope later to remain for some time with you, if the Lord permits.

<p><sup>8</sup> I will remain in Ephesus <font color='#7a8080'>[however]</font> until Pentecost,

<p><sup>9</sup> For a wide door of opportunity for effectual <font color='#7a8080'>[service]</font> has opened to me <font color='#7a8080'>[there, a great and promising one]</font>, and <font color='#7a8080'>[there are]</font> many adversaries.

<p><sup>10</sup> When Timothy arrives, see to it that <font color='#7a8080'>[you put him at ease, so that]</font> he may be fearless among you, for he is <font color='#7a8080'>[devotedly]</font> doing the Lord's work, just as I am.

<p><sup>11</sup> So <font color='#7a8080'>[see to it that]</font> no one despises him <i>or</i> treats him as if he were of no account <i>or</i> slights him. But send him off <font color='#7a8080'>[cordially, speed him on his way]</font> in peace, that he may come to me, for I am expecting him <font color='#7a8080'>[to come along]</font> with the other brethren.

<p><sup>12</sup> As for our brother Apollos, I have urgently encouraged him to visit you with the other brethren, but it was not at all his will <i>or</i> God's will that he should go now. He will come when he has opportunity.

<p><sup>13</sup> Be alert <i>and</i> on your guard; stand firm in your faith (your conviction respecting man's relationship to God and divine things, keeping the trust and holy fervor born of faith and a part of it). Act like men <i>and</i> be courageous; grow in strength!

<p><sup>14</sup> Let everything you do be done in love (true love to God and man as inspired by God's love for us).

<p><sup>15</sup> Now, brethren, you know that the household of Stephanas were the first converts <i>and</i> our firstfruits in Achaia (most of Greece), and how they have consecrated <i>and</i> devoted themselves to the service of the saints (God's people).

<p><sup>16</sup> I urge you to pay all deference to such leaders <i>and</i> to enlist under them <i>and</i> be subject to them, as well as to everyone who joins <i>and</i> cooperates <font color='#7a8080'>[with you]</font> <i>and</i> labors earnestly.

<p><sup>17</sup> I am happy because Stephanas and Fortunatus and Achaicus have come <font color='#7a8080'>[to me]</font>, for they have made up for your absence.

<p><sup>18</sup> For they gave me respite from labor <i>and</i> rested me <i>and</i> refreshed my spirit as well as yours. Deeply appreciate <i>and</i> thoroughly know <i>and</i> fully recognize such men.

<p><sup>19</sup> The churches of Asia send greetings <i>and</i> best wishes. Aquila and Prisca, together with the church <font color='#7a8080'>[that meets]</font> in their house, send you their hearty greetings in the Lord.

<p><sup>20</sup> All the brethren wish to be remembered to you <i>and</i> wish you well. Greet one another with a holy kiss.

<p><sup>21</sup> I, Paul, <font color='#7a8080'>[add this final]</font> greeting with my own hand.

<p><sup>22</sup> If anyone does not love the Lord <font color='#7a8080'>[does not have a friendly affection for Him and is not kindly disposed toward Him]</font>, he shall be accursed! Our Lord will come! (Maranatha!)

<p><sup>23</sup> The grace (favor and spiritual blessing) of our Lord Jesus <i>Christ</i> be with you.

<p><sup>24</sup> My love (that true love growing out of sincere devotion to God) be with you all in Christ Jesus. <i>Amen (so be it).</i>
