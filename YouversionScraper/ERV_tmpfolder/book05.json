He is your Father and your Creator. He made you, and he supports you. Think about what happened so long ago. Ask your father; he will tell you. Ask your leaders; they will tell you. and gave each nation its land. He set up borders for all people. The people of Jacob belong to him. in an empty, windy land. He surrounded them and watched over them. He protected them like the pupil of his eye, She stays close to them, ready to help. She spreads her wings to catch them when they fall and carries them to a safe place. They had no help from any foreign god. They took the harvest in the fields. He gave them honey from the cliffs and olive oil from the rocky ground. He gave them lambs and goats. They had the best rams from Bashan and the finest wheat. They drank the best wine made from the juice of red grapes. (Yes, you people were fed well and became full and fat.) They left the God who made them! They ran away from the Rock who saved them. They made him angry with those disgusting idols. These were new gods they had not known before, gods their ancestors never knew. you forgot the God who gave you life. His sons and daughters made him angry! then let&quot;s see what happens! They are a rebellious people. They are like children who will not learn their lessons. They made me angry with their worthless idols. So I will use people who are not really a nation to make them jealous. burning down to the deepest grave, burning the earth and all it produces, burning deep down below the mountains. I will shoot all my arrows at them. Terrible diseases will destroy them. I will send wild animals against them. Poisonous snakes and lizards will bite them. In their houses, terrible things will happen. Soldiers will kill young men and women. They will kill babies and old people. so that people would forget them completely! The enemy would not understand. They would brag and say, &apos;The Lord did not destroy Israel. We won by our own power!&apos;&quot; They don&quot;t understand. they would understand; they would know what would happen to them. Can two men cause 10,000 men to run away? It will happen only if the Lord gives them to their enemy. This will happen only if their Rock sells them like slaves. Even our enemies know that. like Sodom and Gomorrah. Their grapes are like bitter poison. I have it locked up in my storehouse! But I am saving that punishment for when they slip and do bad things. Their time of trouble is near. Their punishment will come quickly.&quot; They are his servants, and he will show them mercy. He will see that their power is gone. He will see that they are all helpless&ndash; the slaves and free people too. Where is the &apos;rock&apos; that you ran to for protection? And they drank the wine of your offerings. So let them get up and help you! Let them protect you! There is no other God! I put people to death, and I let people live. I can hurt people, and I can make them well. No one can save another person from my power! As surely as I live forever, these things will happen! I will sharpen my flashing sword. I will use it to punish my enemies. I will give them the punishment they deserve. My arrows will be covered with their blood. My sword will cut off the heads of their soldiers.&quot; God punishes people who kill his servants. He gives his enemies the punishment they deserve. And he makes his land and people pure.&apos;"
