It could have become a very good grapevine.&quot;&apos; &apos;Do you think that plant will succeed? No, the new eagle will pull the plant from the ground, and the bird will break the plant&quot;s roots. It will eat up all the grapes. Then the new leaves will wilt. That plant will be very weak. It will not take strong arms or a powerful nation to pull that plant up by the roots. No, the hot east wind will blow, and the plant will become dry and die. It will die there where it was planted.&apos; &apos;I will take a branch from a tall cedar tree. I will take a small branch from the top of the tree, and I myself will plant it on a very high mountain. That branch will grow into a tree. It will grow branches and make fruit and become a beautiful cedar tree. Many birds will sit on its branches and live in the shadows under its branches.
