My speech shall distil as the dew, As the small rain upon the tender grass, And as the showers upon the herb. Ascribe ye greatness unto our God. For all his ways are justice: A God of faithfulness and without iniquity, Just and right is he. They are a perverse and crooked generation. O foolish people and unwise? Is not he thy father that hath bought thee? He hath made thee, and established thee. Consider the years of many generations: Ask thy father, and he will show thee; Thine elders, and they will tell thee. When he separated the children of men, He set the bounds of the peoples According to the number of the children of Israel. Jacob is the lot of his inheritance. And in the waste howling wilderness; He compassed him about, he cared for him, He kept him as the apple of his eye. That fluttereth over her young, He spread abroad his wings, he took them, He bare them on his pinions. And there was no foreign god with him. And he did eat the increase of the field; And he made him to suck honey out of the rock, And oil out of the flinty rock; With fat of lambs, And rams of the breed of Bashan, and goats, With the finest of the wheat; And of the blood of the grape thou drankest wine. Thou art waxed fat, thou art grown thick, thou art become sleek; Then he forsook God who made him, And lightly esteemed the Rock of his salvation. With abominations provoked they him to anger. To gods that they knew not, To new gods that came up of late, Which your fathers dreaded not. And hast forgotten God that gave thee birth. Because of the provocation of his sons and his daughters. I will see what their end shall be: For they are a very perverse generation, Children in whom is no faithfulness. They have provoked me to anger with their vanities: And I will move them to jealousy with those that are not a people; I will provoke them to anger with a foolish nation. And burneth unto the lowest Sheol, And devoureth the earth with its increase, And setteth on fire the foundations of the mountains. I will spend mine arrows upon them: And bitter destruction; And the teeth of beasts will I send upon them, With the poison of crawling things of the dust. And in the chambers terror; It shall destroy both young man and virgin, The suckling with the man of gray hairs. I would make the remembrance of them to cease from among men; Lest their adversaries should judge amiss, Lest they should say, Our hand is exalted, And Jehovah hath not done all this. And there is no understanding in them. That they would consider their latter end! And two put ten thousand to flight, Except their Rock had sold them, And Jehovah had delivered them up? Even our enemies themselves being judges. And of the fields of Gomorrah: Their grapes are grapes of gall, Their clusters are bitter: And the cruel venom of asps. Sealed up among my treasures? At the time when their foot shall slide: For the day of their calamity is at hand, And the things that are to come upon them shall make haste. And repent himself for his servants; When he seeth that their power is gone, And there is none remaining , shut up or left at large. The rock in which they took refuge; And drank the wine of their drink-offering? Let them rise up and help you, Let them be your protection. And there is no god with me: I kill, and I make alive; I wound, and I heal; And there is none that can deliver out of my hand. And say, As I live for ever, And my hand take hold on judgment; I will render vengeance to mine adversaries, And will recompense them that hate me. And my sword shall devour flesh; With the blood of the slain and the captives, From the head of the leaders of the enemy. For he will avenge the blood of his servants, And will render vengeance to his adversaries, And will make expiation for his land, for his people."

With his hands he contended for himself; And thou shalt be a help against his adversaries. Thy Thummim and thy Urim are with thy godly one, Whom thou didst prove at Massah, With whom thou didst strive at the waters of Meribah; Neither did he acknowledge his brethren, Nor knew he his own children: For they have observed thy word, And keep thy covenant.

And his horns are the horns of the wild-ox: With them he shall push the peoples all of them, even the ends of the earth: And they are the ten thousands of Ephraim, And they are the thousands of Manasseh. Rejoice, Zebulun, in thy going out; And, Issachar, in thy tents. There shall they offer sacrifices of righteousness: For they shall suck the abundance of the seas, And the hidden treasures of the sand. Blessed be he that enlargeth Gad: He dwelleth as a lioness, And teareth the arm, yea, the crown of the head. For there was the lawgiver&quot;s portion reserved; And he came with the heads of the people; He executed the righteousness of Jehovah, And his ordinances with Israel. Dan is a lion&quot;s whelp, That leapeth forth from Bashan. O Naphtali, satisfied with favor, And full with the blessing of Jehovah, Possess thou the west and the south. Blessed be Asher with children; Let him be acceptable unto his brethren, And let him dip his foot in oil. And as thy days, so shall thy strength be. Who rideth upon the heavens for thy help, And in his excellency on the skies. And underneath are the everlasting arms. And he thrust out the enemy from before thee, And said, Destroy. The fountain of Jacob alone, In a land of grain and new wine; Yea, his heavens drop down dew. Who is like unto thee, a people saved by Jehovah, The shield of thy help, And the sword of thy excellency! And thine enemies shall submit themselves unto thee; And thou shalt tread upon their high places."
