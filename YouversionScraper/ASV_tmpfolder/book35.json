O Jehovah, revive thy work in the midst of the years; In the midst of the years make it known; In wrath remember mercy. And the Holy One from mount Paran. [Selah His glory covered the heavens, And the earth was full of his praise. He had rays coming forth from his hand; And there was the hiding of his power. And fiery bolts went forth at his feet. He beheld, and drove asunder the nations; And the eternal mountains were scattered; The everlasting hills did bow; His goings were as of old. The curtains of the land of Midian did tremble. Was thine anger against the rivers, Or thy wrath against the sea, That thou didst ride upon thy horses, Upon thy chariots of salvation? The oaths to the tribes were a sure word. [Selah Thou didst cleave the earth with rivers. The tempest of waters passed by; The deep uttered its voice, And lifted up its hands on high. At the light of thine arrows as they went, At the shining of thy glittering spear. Thou didst thresh the nations in anger. For the salvation of thine anointed; Thou woundedst the head out of the house of the wicked man, Laying bare the foundation even unto the neck. [Selah They came as a whirlwind to scatter me; Their rejoicing was as to devour the poor secretly. The heap of mighty waters. My lips quivered at the voice; Rottenness entereth into my bones, and I tremble in my place; Because I must wait quietly for the day of trouble, For the coming up of the people that invadeth us. Neither shall fruit be in the vines; The labor of the olive shall fail, And the fields shall yield no food; The flock shall be cut off from the fold, And there shall be no herd in the stalls: I will joy in the God of my salvation. And he maketh my feet like hinds&quot; feet , And will make me to walk upon my high places. For the Chief Musician, on my stringed instruments."
